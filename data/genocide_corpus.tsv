then Boghossian (the prof, not actor) talks about German involvement being understudied and says that many deportation orders were signed by German generals who "then went on to illustrious careers in the Third Reich" and claims that in many ways German ideas of population control stemmed "partly from their experience in the Ottoman Empire" with similar archival photos of railway cars of Jews and Armenians superimposed onto one another [this is an idea with some currency among scholars of Armenian genocide but with little currency among scholars of Holocaust and Third Reich, the same goes for with similar such claims about Herero and Nama genocide] and then gives AH quote of "who now remembers the extermination of the Armenians"; then shooting day 35 in Spain with corpses in river and George telling main actor Oscar Isaac about what he should do, Isaac and George discuss; then George in v-o says that this film may be the one and only reference audiences get on the genocide and that therefore he wants to show "the full range of atrocities that took place" but also explore what it does to the characters;

more stage performances with dances and music; then interview with Armenian survivor born 1912 who lost her father in death marches and 7-8 other members of her family; then interviewer/director follows her account up again saying "I'm a Greek American and try to explain the fact that Greek Christians, too, and Assyrians, that altogether maybe 6 million people died" and says "this is genocide because the Turks willfully march, knowing that many people would die in the marches"; director/interviewer hopes that her story would "help people understand so this will never happen again"; more singing; then speaker introing a US congressman Alfred Kennedy, talks of need to learn from history, draws connections between other genocides, emphasises importance of recognising Armenian genocide by US; then US senator Aram Garabedian speaks about US recognition of genocide which should happen before 90th anniversary in 2005; then interview with daughter of survivor and survivor (who only speaks Armenian), story of survival is one of a miracle 1915 when two Armenian women prayed not to be killed and all the Turks' weapons fell down and they ran off, hence letting her survive by escaping to Lebanon;

It houses two thousand Bosnian Muslim refugees who were forced to leave their homes when the Serbian forces invaded their towns and villages. Based on their experiences, this film gives an image of their precarious existence. They have lost everything and it is totally unclear what their future will hold. Provided that they have the proper papers, some of them, albeit without their family, can go abroad, where the future is not much brighter for them. Refugees who do not possess the required papers must leave the camp all the same, because it is a transit camp, not a refugee camp." - from: https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/054f87c0-be58-4df2-9aec-c697725f1a81/ordinary-people

But this documentary investigates the possibility of complicity - knowing or not - by the commanders of the United Nations forces in Bosnia. In an investigation conducted over several months, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Roy Gutman, Cabell Bruce, and director Ilan Ziv uncovered intelligence missives, secret U.N. documents, and confidential reports which are the bases for serious charges: U.N. officials grossly miscalculated the Serb government's aggressive designs, ignored their own intelligence, and gave up air defense capabilities, perhaps the only deterrent which could have saved Srebrenica. And then, after the fact, they misrepresented the massacre. SAFE HAVEN details how U.N. Special Envoy Yashushi Akashi and French General Bernard Janvier, head of the U.N. protection force in the former Yugoslavia, agreed not to use force against the Serbs in exchange for French hostages. This "gentlemen's agreement" betrayed the solemn promise of protection made to the people of Srebrenica, and ultimately may have led to the massacres. As a result of this startling report, both men, as well as others involved in the siege of Srebrenica are under investigation by various governing bodies.]

Srebrenica: A Cry from the Grave	1999	Leslie Woodhead	Bosnia	0.75	en	144	BBC	UK	FILE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhvCBC2nlro&ab_channel=OldMovies	[incomplete synopsis; all Serbo-Croation rendered in Engl subtitles, some interviewees speak Engl; gives a day by day and almost hour by hour account of what happened in Srebrenica] Cry from the grave has a Muslim man, later revealed as Naser Oric, stating that both sides fighting in Srebrenica respected the Geneva Convention “and sometimes didn’t respect it – Serbs as well as Muslims” but he points out, correctly, that it was the Serbs that had the military technology and logistics. Voice-over mentions raids by Naser Oriç for food that grow increasingly “bloody”. Interview with Serbian journalist Momcilo Cvjetovic describing an attack on Kravica around Christmas Day 1993, stating “they killed everyone they could find”. Survivor Kadir Habibović escapes a shooting with reconstruction of what happened to him July 14 is identified as the date when “machinery of slaughter” was set in motion and moved to systematic extermination when before men had been more sporadically killed in smaller groups at individual sites. Then Jean-René Ruez talks about Bratunac as the centre of concentration for all captured men and they were ferried to different sites for executions. He states that about 4,000 were killed in this manner. Gives death toll between July 12 and July 16 as “at least 7414 Muslim men” but notes that further killing went on for weeks after Absurd scenes with Dutch UN peacekeepers dancing and singing with beer to music. v-o notes the presence today of more than 32,000 UN troops, NATO airstrikes across Bosnia and Muslim and Croat offensive putting end to war, dividing Bosnia by ethnic lines and turning Srebrenica into an entirely Serb territory Female relative whose husband and son were killed, Saliha Osmanovic, visited by physicians for human rights to take their details and description for identifying bodies. V-o notes only 70 bodies identified to date. Jean René-Ruez interviewed, exhuming mass grave, footage of forensic investigation of dug-out bodies. First exhumations were in 1996, v-o notes difficulties posed by Serb coverups and reburial. Then ICTY trial of Krstic who is charged with genocide and crimes against humanity as highest officer captured, while Mladic so far escapes justice. V-o notes the difficulties of reconciliation with footage of Bosnian Serb celebrations in Srebrenica with a boy joining their army, footage of mourning women at gravesite in Srebrenica while Serb men are “bitter” about Oric’s attacks on surrounding village. Muslim male survivors and women at Potocari Dutch base mourn the dead in 1999, while nearby Serbs celebrate a Serb holy day (with music). Then Oric interviewed, v-o notes he is a successful business man and a “fitness fanatic”, camera shows him working out and boxing, he says of himself “if Naser has to be held accountable, so be it. I’m here, I’m not running from the Hague court” but asks that his actions should be considered in light of what both sides have done to each other. Then v-o talks about ICTY and interviews Louise Arbor, former chief war crimes prosecutor, who understands victims’ impatience but says it takes a long time to gather evidence, Ruez says that at the very least the perpetrators know of their existence and that they can’t sleep easily. Hasan Nuhanovic who was an Muslim interpreter for UN peacekeepers in Srebrenica and lost his entire family, including mother, brother, and father, says that they are organising victims and survivors to bring perpetrators to justice and says they meet resistance because the political perception is that for the future of the country they should reconcile, yet he does not believe there can be reconciliation without justice first.

v-o says that Bosnian-Serbs didn't negotiate and instead relied on their military superiority; first shots fired, v-o says, were a small group of Muslims and Croats who killed a member of a Serb Orthodox wedding and guilty party was not apprehended and thus next day both Muslims and Bosnians set up roadblocks within Sarajevo; various interviewees talk about anti-Serb Western mass media campaigns claiming that Serbs were portrayed as "having been dropped in from another planet" when in reality they had occupied the majority of the land for 1500 years; v-o says "the reality was that all sides had been carrying out ethnic cleansing since the beginning of the war"; v-o portrays Yugoslav army as sole force that could have kept all militias on all sides at bay but was forced to demobilize and their arms "fell into the hands" of Bosnian Serb forces [not quite what happened, see Balkan Babel];

Jovan Divjak Bosniak forces, and a doctor at hospital who claims there were no mortars but there were planted detonation charges; v-o claims Bosnian-Serbs were incentivized to speedily conclude war whereas Bosnians wanted to drag it out until sanctions incapacitate Serbs; then Vance-Owen plan with 10 admin units for different factions with Serbs isolated into enclaves, but American opposition undid plan because it was "not made in America"; another plan was foiled by Americans;

then second Markale massacre  which is ascribed to Muslims again, including by Owen himself who says he kept his information under wraps because Bosnians at the negotiating table would have walked out on such accusations;

then v-o talks about "even bloodier Croatian attack" on Serbian Krajina in Croatia "was yet to come" and v-o and testifying witnesses claim US invovlement but evidence given is US equipment used to jam Serb communication and some claims of airraids on Serbian military facilities that "knocked out radar", then mention of shelling of Knin as "terror bombardment" to drive out the population and v-o says that this was largest ethnic cleansing operation of the war of 200 000 people, then testimony by deputy commander of NATO confirming US helped attack, v-o claims Albanian commander Agim Ceku was responsible for massacre, then UN report of 10 000 Serbs missing from refugees and v-o claims they ended up in mass graves, and v-o further alleges an "unknown number of mass graves" of Serbs in further operations, including one mass grave discovered in 1996 at Mrkonjic Grad that v-o claims to be the largest of the entire war [but in actual fact contained 181 Serbian bodies which by v-o's own skeptical accounting of mass grave of 200 in Srebrenica would be smaller]; v-o then about another Markale shelling which provided "pretext" for NATO to intervene even though v-o cites evidence that shell came from Bosnian camp; old white American male says he studied both Markale attacks and that he is "completely convinced" that Muslims did the shelling; various Americans voice retrospective regrets at quick recognition of republics and US involvement; v-o says Dayton was achieved "at point of a gun" rather than "genuine compromise" and mentions US middle aged man says NATO is an "army of occupation"; then v-o cites a survey that on percentage basis Serbs were more likely to have lost family than Croats or Muslims; then about ICTY which v-o claims was "controversial" among legal experts because it was set up under auspices of UN security council where members could veto to block investigations, then several older US male talking critically about ICTY; v-o and various interviewees then talk about Albright threatening to veto investigations against Croats or Bosnian Muslims; then v-o claims "some" accuse ICTY of double standards when indicting Karadzic and Mladic and v-o says that Tomislav Mercep [who would be arrested and sentenced in 2010], mayor of Vukovar, and Branimir Glavas [sentenced in 2023], and Naser Oric [indicted in 2003, convicted in 2006, acquitted by ICTY on charges of wanton destruction of Serb villages] now runs disco in Tusla and hasn't been prosecuted, mentions non-prosecution of ex-US military and Ceku involved in Operation Storm;

We probably had a free reign to kill everyone"; then archival footage of abouse of 6 young men marched and kicked along by several armed guards; Kosanovic again talks about being posted at the border by Njemci and Laze, because of oil fields; Stoparic also about oil fields and says that all Croats had disappeared and Scorpions secured oil fields as favor to Krajina oil company which backed them with funds; Kosanovic says that the unit was later part of the Serbian Security Service, mentions visits by Zvezdan Jovanović [assassin of Serbia's later prime minister] and Arkan to the Scorpions; Stoparic says he knew Scorpions had connections to Serbia because otherwise they could not have had modern equipment; Kosanovic about re-stationing of unit to Licko Petrovo Selo area, says he was surprised by Medic (shown speaking to troops in archival footage) and says he was a good commander; Stoparic by contrast says he was "nothing but a herdsman" who was not a trained officer, but says he is smart; Kosanovic says he was nicknamed "the owl" because he liked pigeons and climbed trees to catch them; Stoparic says Medic got "filthy rich" through the war with 500 sheeps and millions of German marks, horses etc and Stoparic believes Medic in fact had more, says Medic "was least of all a patriot, he was always a profiteer"; Kosanovic talks about borrowing a video camera to film things in Velika Kladusa; Stoparic says that 100 Muslims were seconded to them, probably Fikret Abdic's Muslims [who were allied to Bosnian Serbs], says a few died in combat whereas none of the Scorpions had yet died; Kosanovic watches football game between Abdic's men and the Scorpions he filmed; then footage of joint fighting, Kosanovic shows his broken finger from fighting; Milorad Ulemek, nicknamed "Legion" [reportedly ordered assassination of Serbia's later prime minister], in footage with Kosanovic saying that he was professional and that their CO was not as good and that his unit was better trained too; Kosanovic talks about Abdic's unit taking one prisoner (a young man in trench very nervous, as shown in footage) and Kosanovic talks about "package" (=prisoner) and that in communications they said there should never have been prisoners but that they can now send the prisoner over to clear mines; Kosanovic looks at his film on tv which shows a long line of prisoners; Kosanovic talks about how his footage of Ulemek commanding the units was one of his favorite vidoes; Stoparic says that he realised he should "go with a unit from Serbia" but then heard stories "about how they killed. Really bad"; footage of young men lying face down in dirt, while armed men around them talk about how "we'll kill two and let four go" all laugh, then they ask if the men ever got laid, then one of the guards shoots over their heads; Stoparic says "It happened all over again in Kosovo", says that Scorpions are "like muppets" compared to some "Special Operations Unit reservists such as Slobodan "Lugar" Nikolic, "Tralja", the "Student", a guy caled the "Gladiator" "and Zvezdan was said to be their commanding officer"; then Stoparic talks about operation in Pudojevo (Kosanovic says he wasn't part of this operation), says that if it had been a proper army things would have been done properly (archival footage of soldiers stopping civilians in car at gunpoint); Stoparic says he didn't pay attention until he realised many women being brought out, names Cvjetan, Guljo, Dragan Borojevic, Demirovic, Zicko as being involved, then he sidetracks and talks about women coming up to him and he was wondering why children weren't crying and women not talking to him and he now assumes they knew they were going to die, and then he says that once women were with Cvjetan and co. he heard shooting, first one weapon, then several (all over semi-related archival images over troops moving, women and children crying); Stoparic claims he tried to stop it, but was stopped by Medic ("Boco"), claims that based on the rumors and stories it was Cvjetan and Guljo who shot and the othes had been watching, emphasises that "Nobody fired at us. Nobody", says he was in Podujevo street only 10 minutes and "in ten minutes they pissed all over my war"; Stoparic continues, says Demirovic [=Guljo?] and Cvjetan bragging about it the next day, says only Borojevic mostly kept quiet because he had been in prison for murder and thus knew the consequences of prosecution; Stoparic says was once called by Borojevic threatening him (over archival footage of Sasa Cvjetan at escorted by police to trial [?]); Stoparic says he often thinks of them and says "I would lock him in a room with a picture of children, not necessarily those exact children, just kids: black, white, yellow, all kinds. And leave him in there to look at the picture for seventeen years."; then archival footage of orthodox priests while Stoparic talks about Djeletovci; then Kosanovic looks at his footage in tv again and explains their isignia and emblems with priests speaking to the unit in footage saying the Turks have risen again "like the vampires they are", evokes the ancient battle of Kosovo, and says "Turks are unlike other men, they are all beasts from Asia"; Kosanovic points out the various unit members in the footage, Zoran Rakic (his cousin), Slobodan Davidovic (his "buddy") who was "charged and convicted of a crime in Croatia", Srecko who was killed when Scorpions fell apart, Pera Petrasevic, charged with murder in Trnovo, Branislav Medic, charged with murder in Treskavica, cousin Zlatko, cousin Momic who has been indicted, cousin Sico -- then briefly notes that the strength of the Scorpions was all the family ties -- Goran Stoparic; Stoparic comments on the tape; then Kosanovic points out Milan "Mrgud" Milanovic, "Legion" and "Boco" (Slobodan Medic); then Kosanovic talks about Milanovic and general Loncar deciding operation in Treskavica; Stoparic says the rumor was they would attack Sarajevo; talks about Franko or Franki Simatovic who was CO of the Red Berets at the time (footage of Red Berets shown); Kosanovic points out Slobodan "the Bulgar" Stojkovic; Kosanovic about going to Trnovo; then Kosanovic looks at footage of them, including Slobodan Davidovic, washing themselves in river; then Kosanovic comments on footage of unit members skinning a snake and eating it; Kosanovic talks about how he chatted with Boco and Momic and others about "boyhood" stuff which led to a dispute because, in part, Kosanovic was not respecting the rank of his CO since they had been together in a boyhood gang, says he left his camera to Slobodan Stojkovic; Kosanovic then looks at footage of him and Aleksandar Medic; Stoparic talks about a special unit being brought in "to make a diversion, to pretend to attack the city", says they broke through their lines, but by evening were back to old positions to make Muslims pull out their forces from Srebrenica and then Srebrenica and Zepa fell right away; Stoparic talks about going to headquarters with "Boco" at Treskavica to get supplies, but then a bus with police plates 606 pulled up and the bus was full of people who were being pulled out and they were from Srebrenica and then "the order then came to to space out the prisoners and kill them..." and then the driver turned around and Stoparic speculates that probably they had sent out such minibuses with people to be killed in different directions; "Boco" thought about it and then told them, "us", to liquidate the prisoners in the mountains and told the cameraman, "the Bulgar"; Kosanovic says that once they were in Treskavica they were told to replace the Scorpion emblem with the Serbian tricolor, he doesn't know if it was someone else's or "Boco's" orders; Stoparic says "when I saw what was happening, I said to young Darko that we should go, I wanted to warn the men and tell one of the commanders up there, a nice guy, that the idiot was sending people up there to be killed. I knew his mind and that he wouldn't do it"; Once out of Trnovo, Stoparic says he stayed 200m ahead of them to stay out of sight of the camera, then he heard "Boco" tell the troops over radio that they should stop instead and get it over with somewhere; then fullscreen of footage of with title "july 1995" with prisoners getting out of truck, captioned Safet Fejzic (1978), Dino Salihovic (1979), Juso Delic (1970, nose bloody), Sidik Salkic (1959), Azmir Alispahic (1978), Smail Ibrahimovic (1960), all lying down face first in dirt; Kosanovic looks at youth pictures of Slobodan Medic, Petar Mitrovic, deputy platoon commander, Stojkovic ("the Bulgar"); then execution video continues with Aleksandar Medic ("Zara"), Slobodan Davidovic ("Bodo"), Branislav Medic ("Zekan"), Milorad Momic, Djole Siptar, Pero Petrasevic captioned; then executions shown with each victim stepping forward and getting shot while others watch their frontman getting shot, Serbs swear, ask "the Bulgar" whether he filmed it and tell him to "go to hell", ask if they should finish off the last two, then someone asks "which one is still croaking?"; the men on the ground are finished off, some are still twitching, while the two survivors carry off the corpses; lengthy scene of survivors dragging bodies around, they are then shot inside a house, camera makes closeup as they fire half a dozen rounds into head and body; Kosanovic says "the genocide, that is the killing of those six Muslim civilians, should be condemned. I would say it's all been pinned on the Scoprions but as the trial has shown and as is know [sic], it wasn't our commander Boco. Now the Scorpions are being smeared and are blamed for everything. But there was someone else who ran the operation"; then footage of exhumation in 1999 while Stoparic says in v-o "If iI ever have a son, I'll teach him not to pay taxes to Serbia or serve in its army. I had to pay for my stupid mistakes and can teach others to avoid making them."; title card says "Sasa Cvjetan was sentenced to 20 years for the war crime in Podujevo.

then v-o talks about International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) in The Hague to identify victims which was established in 1996 with director-general Kathryne Bomberger interviewed talking about their identification process and saying that cover up was very extensive and later says that 70% of missing persons "have now been accounted for" which is "unprecedented" and says from Srebrenica almost 90% of victims have been identified;

McCloskey and Bomberger and Kandic all emphasizing the strength of the evidence and Kandic says that denial doesn't have much future with stills of headlines of Serbian politicians issuing denials, then Hoefer much the same and says that as a German it took Germany "at least two generations to be really able to admit our guilt" (with footage of Nuremberg trial) and she is "in that sense I'm also hopeful", Hasanovic says people should "face the fact that this was genocide" and reconciliation cannot start without "sincerely admitting it"; intertitle saying "Hasan Hasanovic now works as a curator and translator at the Potocari Memorial centre where he shares his stories and those of the many victims of the conflict with visitors from around the world"; v-o then concludes that with DNA evidence and testimony of over 1000 witnesses were genocide and that tribunal also showed that those who committed the crimes "will not excape justice" and two side by side wanted posters shown on left from 2000 with the faces of prominent perpetrators (including Mladic and Karadzic) and on right from 2011 just an empty poster with stamp "no fugitives"; then judge Agius addressing audience as in beginning and says the truth will be established; title card "The ICTY convicted 16 persons for genocide and/or other crimes after the fall of Srebrenica" and "The case of Radovan Karadzic is currently under appeal with the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT)" [appeal was rejected in 2019 sentence was increased to life] and "Jovica Stanisic and Franko Simatovic are being re-tried by the MICT" and "Slobodan Milosevic died before his trial ended" and "Ratko Mladic received a sentence of life imprisonment. \n His defense has indicated that he will appeal" [appeal was denied in 2021];

[pause] The cities are empty"; then footage of labor and v-o says that cambodians work on large construction projects and rice fields, "According to official estimates there are at least 2.5 million workers", claims that Cambodia "is not a hungry country" but says that it is "unusual" "because of its organization, its way of life and the relations which are dominating this country's economics", says that "priority is given to poor workers and peasants" and they carried out the  "difficult task" of the revolution, then reproduces Samphan's statistics saying that "government statistics show that before the revolution 85% of peasants lived on the edge of poverty" and most worked on "land owned by the rich" and were indebted, the v-o asks to audience and Pol Pot what society Cambodia is trying to build; then Pol Pot sitting in chair speaking to side who says "we do not have a model on which to build our society", says that peasants make up the majority of their society and contributed the most to the revolution and thus they need to benefit the most, says their goal is a society in which "everyone is happy" and equality and progress reigns and no one is exploited; v-o says "it does not matter if you were born in the city or in the countryside. All citizens live today in the cooperatives on the rice fields" (with KR propaganda songs in background), talks about upping rice exports and mentions use of rice for exchanging for industrial goods, then v-o says "it is said that every citizen receives 312 kg of rice per year" (over footage of Cambodians working with rice); v-o says that each cooperative consists of 10 000 to 20 000 people and that "some have received new houses", says everything is collective ownership, cattle etc., but that cooperatives are not only limited to agricultural production but also handicrafts and mentions the craftsmen use material from American bombs dropped "en masse" across Cambodia; says men work in fields or are soldiers and women do the "rest" although there is no strict division of labor; then mentions particular cooperative in Takeo province which the male v-o describes as "society of equals", talks about collective eating and that cooperatives are "everything" to its members, then says that if "a boy and girl like each other" they have to ask their leader and he decides but also that "a wedding request is never denied" (over footage of men and women standing separate from one another in neat order); then footage of children and v-o claims Cambodia can provide for 20 million people and thus the population can grow and that this is in fact the "military's strategic aim" while people stare dispassionately into camera; footage of city in which everything is closed, then footage of ruins of national bank, v-o talks about the abolition of money; then Kampot saltworks with an all-female work crew, most of whom are not married acc. to v-o, but then introes woman Chhan, now 28, but at time of revolution 19, who is the leader and has a child but they see husband / father rarely, v-o talks of 9 hour work days and 3 days per month dedicated to "political education"; then footage of the sea and "barefoot boys" from Kompong Som, "their age is difficult to guess" who are pulling in fishing boats, then introes their leader who has no experience with fishing or boats and grew up poor but upon approaching the revolutionary committee he was sent to "organize a fishing fleet" (meanwhile footage of bare feet of child workers), says harbor in Kompong Som is the only link Cambodia has to the rest of the world but only 7 ships per month come to the port which come from "China, Japan, Singapore, Yugoslavia and Korea" and says that rice and rubber are exported from here while petroleum and industrial goods are imported, v-o briefly introes Kry who manages the port but also didn't grow up near the sea; then footage of warehouse being rebuilt that was destroyed by American bombs, v-o relates that they asked who the engineer is and that they received the reply "we learn from practice. This is the work of laborers and peasants" and that they ask "how are the workers being paid?" and receive the response "there are no wages. The state is giving us everything we need"; then footage of "one of the few [factories] that still exists" in Phnom Penh which produces pumps, child laborers are shown, which v-o calls "the children of the revolution" and says that "boys and girls are brought here from the revolution" and that previously they "were carrying arms", v-o says "on average, they are officially 17; unofficially, a lot less" and comments quite ironically "this is the new working class of Kampuchea"; then footage of school for electricians (with footage of boys at electrical masts) and v-o says "same images, same answers. The only difference is that there are no girls" but says that before revolution only those with high school degree could attend the technical school but that not many children could afford to go to high school, mentions that there are "few school manuals" and that "theory and practice are intertwined", v-o says that previous generation was trained by American-supported regime and committed a lot of "sabotage", v-o asks "but who are the teachers?" and reply is that "revolutionaries pass on their knowledge" with more footage of children at tools; but v-o says main focus of govt. is not on industry but "agricultural production", then mentions Cambodia produces 312 kg rice per head annually and that it needs water for this, with footage of dams, reservoirs, and channels, then footage of dam of "30th of September", which is the founding date of the communist party, where 200 000 workers are who come mostly from neighboring collectives but a third of workers comes from "mobile brigade" for whom "there is no rest" and who move from worksite to worksite, over footage of children v-o asks "among those boys and girls, can you recognize the city kids? Many were displaced after the victory of the revolution. It's hard to tell who's from where. Differences that existed between those from the cities and villages have disappeared in the course of the last 3 years"; then footage from 1970 of lively Phnom Penh intersection before evacuation when it was a city of 600 000 people and then rose to 2 million people during civil war with v-o saying many people died from hunger then, then edited contrast to Phnom Penh in 1978 with v-o asking "where are the city dwellers?" and says "they are all around the country on fields and construction sites. They are just not in the cities anymore", over shots of parked and overgrown cars; then Pol Pot interview again who says "there are many reasons why we emptied the cities: first of all economical. We realized that we couldn't feed the people [smiles] if the population stays in the cities. We have the cooperatives that can receive them and engage them in agricultural production. The country also faced security problems. We knew about the enemies' plans. They wanted to create economic, political, and military problems. This was to destroy our revolution. We took this situation into account. We moved the city population to the villages. At the same time, we resolved the problem of nutrition. We destroyed American Imperialist plans to ruin our country. [smiles] City evacuation wasn't planned in advance. We were forced to make a quick decision"; v-o claims "three years after the revolution nutrition problems have been solved. Kampuchea's cities are still empty. It's said that 200 000 people live in Phnom Penh today. By our estimate, it is far less." v-o notes that the parks are taken care of with branches pruned and that city is clean "but the city is sadly empty", v-o asks when the post offices will be reopened, and asks if cities will remain permanently empty, says "the peasants won" and that "this revolution is not based on any precedents"; then male Yugoslav reporter addresses the camera directly while sitting on stairs, says Cambodia "chose a specific path. Commitments have been made, regardless of the costs", says that Cambodia "should be introduced into culture, education, and religion"; v-o notes that Cambodia had several universities before revolution and that "it produced more university graduates than it could employ" and that most educated elites were from rich city populations who could pay for tuition but then says "today, Kampuchea has gone the other extreme. All high schools and universities are closed"; then choir of singing girls with v-o saying that in this village school boys and girls are learning separately and says that in fields there are a lot more children that should be in classrooms instead, says the "teacher didn't even finish school" and got his "teaching license" during the revolution, over footage of boys in school; then v-o talks about cultural policies which are "strictly national" and that "old colonial influences should be eradicated"; then v-o about religion where before revolution Cambodia had about 300 000 buddhist monks who "were living on alms" but now there is no longer Buddhism, says that Buddhism was religion of the poor and the rich used it for "propaganda", v-o says that "it is said" that as political consciousness grew monks joined the revolution and people stopped being religious, then shows a Cambodian man who "was once a monk" who is now a "manager on a construction site" and for whom Buddhism is not opposed to communism, v-o says few pagodas were spared by the war; then footage of collective performance with v-o talking about culture being regulated by the state and that "there is only one state cultural ensemble. Performances reflect the political and national visions" (performers wwave red flags), v-o says that one of the visions is "independence" and that "until recently, the enemy wasn't identified. Now everyone is speaking loudly and clearly about the enemy. This is the previous war ally - Vietnam. The division between the two countries is complete." performers with AK-47s; then footage of ships on Mekong which is shortest route from capital to sea but also leads through Vietnam and thus closed to ships with Cambodian flag, v-o says that "faced with this outside danger [of Vietnam], people have put aside internal problems"; more mention of empty Phnom Penh and few employees in ministries, including the Assembly of the People's Representatives "it holds sessions only once a year. It's role is to confirm government decisions"; then Pol Pot interviewed again with v-o saying that Pol Pot for first time gives his biography before the camera and claims "I am the son of peasants" and that according to the "customs" "I lived in the pagoda for six years in order to study. I was a monk for two years" says he couldn't enter college "because I failed the entry exam" so he returned to village and stayed with parents to later graduate from a technical school, but later got scholarship to study in France and says he was a good student in his first year there but then joined "the student movement" and his scholarship was taaken away, then he returned to fight "French colonialism" and worked as a teacher in early 1950s but left the city for the partisans [this surely must have been meaningful to a Yugoslavia founded by ex-WWII partisans] in 1963 and returned to Phnom Penh (laughs), v-o says Pol Pot had been with communist party since 1960 and its party secretary since 1963; then footage of labor in countryside with v-o saying "here ends our story about Kampuchea. It chose its own path towards the future in 1975." with shots of mostly young men / boys passing the camera; then shot of setting sun; credits; end		None				None				H

Kissinger unleashed 100,000 tons of bombs the equivalent of five hiroshimas. the bombing was their personal decision illegally and secretly they bombed Cambodia a neutral country back to the Stone Age and I mean Stone Age in its literal sense", but in April 1975 KR took over Phnom Penh (with stills shown) and described as "mostly teenagers"; yet the "horror began almost immediately Phnom Penh a city of two and a half million people was forcibly emptied within hours of their coming with sick and wounded being dragged from their hospital beds dying children being carried in plastic bags" (with photos of elderly and children shown); then mentions that KR called 1975 "Year Zero" and says that "there would be no families no sentiment no expressions of love or grief no medicines, no hospitals, no schools, no books, no learning, no holidays, no music, no song, no post, no money, only work and death", mentions invsibility of Cambodian suffering with population of 7 million of whom 2 million "are missing, believed murdered" which is 1/3 of the country's population and says that "proportionately it's Birmingham, Manchester, and London exterminated"; then says "what follows is the first complete film report by Westerners from the ashes of a gentle land and I have to say there are scenes which may upset some of you"; then footage of Phnom Penh in 1979 "abandoned as if in the wake of a nuclear war", contrasted with shots of Phnom Penh before KR which Pilger remembers "the capital of a land of plenty" and mentions Chinese proverb of "as rich as Cambodia"; then talks about Sihanouk who is described as a "self-styled God king" and "demagogue" among others and who "preserved Cambodia's independence like an absurd juggler in a cockpit of war" but in 1970 was "overthrown in the chaos that followed the American bombing" and then v-o talks about "in the spring of 1969 American B-52s had begun the secret bombing of neutral Cambodia. These top-secret military cables obtained under the Freedom of Information Act were part of a cover-up that was the real beginning of Watergate. the pilots were sworn not to tell even their superiors and their logs were falsified. the official aim of the bombing was to wipe out a Viet Cong base in Cambodia a base that existed only in the imagination of American generals" (over archival footage of bombings) and "the Cambodians who died were called collateral damage and their burning villages were called friendly fire" and then describes US invasion of Cambodia "a member of dr.

"middle class" and women and children and ages from 1 to older than 50 and when asked the same man responds that he has a child of his own; then Peck says that his wife and 5 of his children were killed and only one daughter remains alive, all of them through starvation, then is asked what he felt on the day of liberation as one of only 8 who survived (with help of female interpreter but overall interview in Engl) and he says he was very glad; then Pilger says that of the 8 survivors were a painter and sculptor who survived because they maint busts or paintings of a "god-like" Pol Pot, some footage of corpses from S21 is shown; then v-o narrates testimony of Prak Sarin [sic?] when KR took all his school children and deported them to the countryside who mostly died of "exhaustion" and Pilger then gives statistic (over footage of bones and skulls in fields) of 990 000 primary school children "before Year Zero" but "of these 670 000 are missing"; then present-day footage of children from the 558 people in the "main hospital in Phnom Penh" most of whom are children and are dying because of lack of food and medical supplies, then recounts meeting with a representative from Red Cross who approached Pilger if he had contacts in govt. and who talked about "that the United Nations Britain included still recognizes the defeated murderous regime of the Khmer Rouge and it's difficult to get official help for a people whose new government [ruled by the Vietnamese] still does not diplomatically" and Pilger says "of course if you're in Geneva or New York or London you can't hear the screams of the little boy I mentioned" with footage of crying baby shown, followed by successive footage of two barely alive boys on iron bed frames, the latter naked and described as Khun Suk [sic?] aged 10 who is dead the next day, Pilger then says that only 2 Western doctors were in Cambodia who are then interviewed in English, with one with French accent saying that biggest problem is malnutrition, shows footage of a starving one year old girl and another child with malnutrition, the other doctor talks about psychological conditions with families "systematically" separated, then doctors examine another skeletal 12 year old boy who is described as a case of "typical malnutrition with skin disease" and whom Pilger says he is "literally skin and bone" and asks doctors if he can be saved and the doctors say "it's possible" but suspects that he also has other diseases which they cannot diagnose because, as Pilger in v-o then says, KR destroyed all modern equipment and states that of "550 doctors in Cambodia 48 survived" over footage of more starving, unmoving children on iron bed frames; doctors go on to describe the emergency and they answer affirmatively when Pilger asks them whether "because of the West's attitude towards the boat people refugees [i.e. the refugee crisis starting in 1975 at end of Vietnam war until early 1980s, fleeing communist Vietnam by boat, of them 200 000 to 400 000 died by mostly drowning] then they are not allowing aid to come through to Cambodia" and French doctor says that food assistance to Cambodia is "suppressed" in same way as in Vietnam and French doctor remarks that even though Vietnam itself struggles medically and nutritionally nonetheless gives aid to Cambodia, Pilger then goes on to echo this point showing food trucks from Vietnam which, "although itself facing famine", sends "more than 25 000 tons of food to Cambodia" and states that "the Vietnamese have managed to do this by asking every family in their southwestern provinces to give 6 pounds of rice. by contrast Western governments have sent only a dribble of aid" and Pilger then criticises Western aid agencies for "supplying what is left of Pol Pot's army of genocide" while withholding "aid from 90% of the Cambodian people" and points out that "last month the United Nations General Assembly was witness to the extraordinary spectacle of the Western democracies, America and Britain included, voting to continue recognition of a defunct regime which they themselves acknowledge as the most thorough murderers since Hitler" because they don't want to upset the newest trading partner China which supports Pol Pot; Pilger then cites Oxfam's director general Brian Walker who said "we've had only complete and honorable cooperation from the Cambodian government and the Vietnamese. When I left Cambodia, said Walker, the total input of Western aid over nine months amounted to 200 tons of food. I don't see how anyone can be proud of that situation" over footage of more starving people, especially younger children; then French doctor talks about those infected with anthrax who die because of a lack of penicillin and who die within 1-2 weeks if untreated and doctors point out that it's not seen in Europe and talks of a girl with anthrax in her face who is groaning and the doctors predict she will "die in the next week"; v-o Pilger then describes the situation in which one Vietnamese doctor has to decide every morning who is to live and to die, and v-o says that a third of pregnancies is a miscarriage and at least 50% of women have no menstruation; then footage of a woman who "begged us for medicine before she died", she is groaning in footage and her face is shown in close up, followed by footage of children; then Pilger describes effect of American bombing on Cambodian children and says that "the price of a Cambodian life was incidentally $100 compensation", then talks about Shawcross who interviewed Sihanouk who [at that time, no longer now] who held Nixon and Kissinger responsible for rise of KR (with photos of Pol Pot and Sihanouk shown); then footage of agricultural workers in Cambodia who are now living in the "Stone Age" and goes on to give example of one woman 16 of whose members were killed for being "unproductive" with their throats slit; v-o then says "the Vietnamese are condemned for driving out the Khmer Rouge killers. were the Tanzanians condemned for throwing out the hideous Idi Amin? of course not! it should be explained why the Vietnamese came here to Cambodia after 1975. Vietnam was under constant attack by the Khmer Rouge who massacred Vietnamese border villages and were supported by 10,000 Chinese. An unholy trinity of Pol Pot China and America say that Vietnam is an agent of Russia"; then goes on to describe continuing struggle of Vietnam and Cambodia; finally back to empty Phnom Penh and v-o describes Sihanouk's financial excesses; then shows orphanage of children "found in the forest" who "have lost their identity"; then shows "first school in Phnom Penh to reopen"; then v-o describes encounter with a 12 year old boy who had forgotten his name and parentage but thinks parents are dead over footage of more crying and suffering children; then Obama in interview again who urges that in next 6 months help needs to arrive, followed by more footage of moaning and crying children; Pilger ends with appeal "if the horrors in this documentary are to have any purpose it is not just to assault your emotions it is to end the silence and indifference contrived by governments and relief agencies and to put Cambodia back on the human map" and describes Vietnam as having saved the country from "possible extinction" and "slavery" and cites his own interpreter "a young girl, was due to be killed" on the day of liberation, then describes report to "United Nations Commission on Human Rights with information as shocking as anything you have seen tonight" and indicts Western govts. for "allowing people to die" "because governments including our own are bent on isolating and punishing the Vietnamese" and that "saving Cambodia would mean cooperating with Vietnam" and states that "America and Europe hold most of the world's surplus food, [but] we feed it to animals" and urges again "there are six months to save a nation of mostly children is that impossible"; end credits interspersed with footage of dying children; after credits Pilger again says that "since this film was made more relief has reached Cambodia from Vietnam the Eastern Bloc countries Australia Britain's Oxfam and some other Western charities and the food situation has slightly improved but throughout Cambodia hunger and disease and trauma a widespread" and states that Vietnam requested 100 000 tons of food but Western total aid amounted to 1300 tons and "effectively that's almost nothing" and says that "this situation is likely to continue as long as Western governments recognize and give international comfort to Pol Pot, the Asian Hitler.

Pilger in v-o mentions poor, low yield seed with "up to 40% rebate" is distributed at border and cites April UNICEF report that was confirmed by investigative office of state department, although Pilger says that this is not to say the aid last year didn't save "a great many lives";

They deserve more than cynicism and shame."; Brown says there has been 30 years of war in Cambodia and that a detente and negotiations are needed; Howard says effectively the same; then Pilger to camera says that in NYC an official of KR living in comfort is still a representative of KR and UN will likely vote to continue KR presence there, and Pilger says that Cambodians fear nothing more than return of Pol Pot even though that seems to be current international policy, and that Cambodians just want peace, to have normal children, and normal lives, "certainly I find it difficult to cope with the thought that the children in this film may have survived only to suffer war and famine yet again, because your generosity has never been matched by a political generosity by so-called civilized governmnets"; end credits over footage of a smiling Cambodian girl walking with flower	direct	Khmer Rouge	M		China		urbanites, educated middle class		FALSE	H

Nuon Chea], and says China has to support KR because "they can bleed" out the Vietnamese; v-o says that Vietnamese had proved military prowess and refused to bow to China and had angered China when persecuting Chinese minority in Vietnam with hundreds of thousands "were forced to leave as boat people or overland refugees" and v-o says "now their economy was one of the worst but their army one of the largest" and says that "Vietnamese were secretly planning for a new military campaign"; then interview with Nayan Chanda, captioned as "author & journalist", says Vietnamese prepared "to set up a regime in Cambodia" and consulted the Soviets and "signed a treaty of friendship" in 1978 with Soviets; then interview with smoking Alan Dawson sitting by typewriter, captioend as "author & journalist", who talks about "fairly small attack into Vietnam" by KR in 1978 and then Vietnam "decided to go for broke" and decribes the strategy of "blooming lotus" to penetrate deep into Cambodia via three main highways, with footage, with goal to penetrate as quickly as possible which was successful within 2 weeks; then v-o talks of Vietnamese control of Cambodia and Pol Pot's "terror" regime was over, Vietnamese even sought to capture Sihanouk but KR flew him out to China; back to Dawson who says it may be confusing to see communists fighting communists but claims that "Vietnamese control of Indochina is a basic tenet" and was inevitable one way or another [thereby confirming KR conspiracies]; then footage of "Vietnamese government film" whose v-o talks about the empty cities and munitions stockpiles sent by China, also uses the jargon of "Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique", then footage of "a school" which is in fact S-21 with footage of liberation and corpses on bed, v-o mentions 11 dead bodies in 11 former classrooms and a further body in the yard, footage shows photographs esp. of children, footage of photos of corpses with throats slit; Sihanouk interview says "Pol Pot is mad, you know, like Hitler" and wanted to crush all opposition incl. of communists; back to Vietnamese govt. film which points to the portraits of Pol Pot in S-21 intimating a personality cult [that never was; see Chandler's bio of Pol Pot]; Sihanouk continues comparison between Pol Pot and Hitler, says that Pol Pot has his Himmler; then back to Vietnamese govt. film which shows footage of orphaned and starving children; back to Sihanouk about Pol Pot and Hitler, with footage of crying women, while Sihanouk changes tack and says that Pol Pot's madnees does not "give Vietnamese the permission to colonize and Vietnamize my country" [thus in some way supporting the KR rationale]; Dawson again about Pol Pot seeking to regroup to counterattack and seeking support by Thailand; then doc's v-o about China attacking Vietnam with heavy casualties and eventually being driven out by Vietnamese without needing Soviet help, footage of trucks going into Cambodia with v-o saying that Vietnamese "boasted" the situation in Cambodia is "irreversible" and Vietnamese installing a govt.

The new government backed by the Vietnamese was loath to admit that there was any crisis at all" and in 1979 "turned away offers of help from both the Red Cross and the United Nations" with footage of starving and famine was "even more appalling for those who had fled from the Vietnamese. These were the families and followers of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge who had managed to escape with their leaders to the jungle", talks of lack of medicine and supplies over footage of corpses in jungle, then mentions KR were "finally" allowed to enter Thailand and "for the first time their plight was exposed to the international press and television, suddenly the famine in Kampuchea became headline news" and "at last emergency aid began to flow" with footage of rice distribution, then other refugees fleeing towards border who were "quite separate from the KR" and who called themselves "the free Khmer" and tried to escape famine, KR, and the Vietnamese, with footage of camps that were "ruled by black marketeers and warlords"; then footage of fighting with v-o mentioning attacks on the camps by the Thais, the KR, and the Vietnamese, and "rival guerilla bands", with footage of crying children with artillery in background and v-o says "this time the attack came from Thailand" with 100 dead and footage of dead and wounded children shown, then a man crying about having lost his last remaining child; then footage of music performance shown quite elaborately; then says that despite KR "madness" the "borderlands" were a magnet "because here there was famine relief that Kampucheans could count on" but then says "the lion's share of international aid was eventually shipped to the Vietnamese side, but at the height of the crisis it was the aid that flowed directly across the border that proved to be effective" [omitting that this was a result of anti-Vietnam embargo and geostrategic policy by US, China, and ASEAN], then mentions camps being used as a landbridge to funnel food and goods back into country because "the Vietnamese" had forbidden to use roads or railroads with footage of people transporting goods with "up to 100 000 traffickers" participating in journeys that could take weeks while bandits and Vietnamese soldiers were lying in wait, v-o says Vietnamese turned blind eye because black market "provided a lifeline" [again omitting embargo]; v-o says "ironically Kampuchea had fallen back on capitalism in its crudest form" and says that "the only productive energy worth speaking of was profiteering" and thus there was little incentive to work in govt. or work in agriculture; then someone interviewing Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnamese foreign minister, in Engl. about overthrow of KR in mere 2 weaks but a subsequent famine lasting 2 years "why?", Thach corrects "famine" by "the food situation", points out that they have been torn apart by war for 30 years, compares to WWII and says Cambodia-Vietnam was bombed twice as much and says that "if European countries" needed 5 years to recover "we need at least 30 years", then unidentified reporter asks "why didn't the socialist respond more quickly" to the "immediate crisis", Thach points out starvation was due to Pol Pot who had reigned "since 75" and claims that "the socialist countries have done their best" but also points out that there was help from other, Western countries; Dawson says that "there's no question" that Vietnamese army is "necessary" to "stop a Pol Pot takeover" "but I think the question of Vietnamese total withdrawal simply does not arise" and points to Vietnamese behaviour towards Cambodia over the last few hundred years was to move people over and then follow with the army and now it's reverse so to him "entirely logical to presume" that there will be a "real colonialism" of Indochina dominated by "ethnic Vietnamese"; then Sihanouk talks about Heng Samrin as puppet regime while cartoonish puppets with angry faces are shown [displaying Heng Samrin it seems] while Sihanouk talks of "more and more there are Vietnamese settlers from Vietnam and our people becomes [sic] slaves of Moscow and Hanoi" and compares Cambodia's fate to that of South Vietnam; v-o says that "as an army of occupation" the Vietnamese were "remarkably liberal at first" and "allowed freedom of movement" and Buddhist worship and "they were at pains to disguise their communism from any reminder of Pol Pot's rule, but that was bound to change" and once famine "receded" "the world lost interest" but "the Vietnamese stayed on and the longer they stayed, the longer they bred resentment. They imposed conscription and forced labor" and mentions political prisoners, secret arrests, and torture; then some archival radio broadcast and v-o talk about anti-Vietnamese "resistance", then Sihanouk calls Vietnamese "very imperialist", "very colonialist", followed by footage of sweating Sihanouk at night talking to an audience and saying they will continue the fight; then footage of elderly Sihanouk entering coalition of resistance against "foreign rule" which put him "for the second time' as v-o says into the same camp as the KR, footage of Son Sann who is introed by v-o, then footage of Sihanouk speech about being supported by UN and others while Vietnamese are isolated; another Sihanouk speech to unclear audience who says that he had tried to settle disputes with Vietnamese "peacefully" but now it's too late and he joined the coalition; v-o talks about Sihanouk still being "revered as the living god king" by Cambodians but others not understanding how he could once again join the KR; then Sihanouk says 5 children and 14 of his grandchildren were killed by KR and says "we cannot wipe out the KR and so we have to try to soften their behaviour" and says he tells them "please avoid to be cruel" but also says "I am not sure if they have changed their mind" [!!]; v-o talks about Chinese aid shipped to Thailand to bleed the Vietnamese, v-o points out Pol Pot was crucial to the guerilla war with 40 000 militia, and even when Vietnamese later overran the camps and other resistance factions were weakened the KR fought on; then KR propaganda campaign that "yes some mistakes were made" but that Vietnamese accusations against them of genocide were "conspiracy" and that KR had renounced communism altogether and dissolved the communist party; then Ieng Sary at KR meeting claiming communist party was founded to counter the Vietnamese, interpreter in English says the main purpose was to fight Vietnamese and that the Vietnamese were always against communist KR party [which is entirely false]; then Thai officials at diplomatic meeting but supporting resistance that includes KR together with US and China, but KR cause embarrassment, so Sihanouk is put at the helm of reistance representation; interview with Sihanouk who talks about continuing the tradition of "ancient Khmer kings", speaks at dining table, then Sihanouk at official rally protected by military, video of Sihanouk being interviewed in forest while v-o talks about Sihaouk continual attempts to resign then actually resigning in 1987 and beginning talks with the Heng Samrin "regime" and the Vietnamese; long scene with Sihanouk on golden reading effectively a letter of praise about himself that ends with statement the Sihanouk leading the country would be the best option right now, Sihanouk apologizes bashfully and says a "diplomat" Sylvana Foa [actually a US journalist] wrote this, he asks viewers and filmmakers to ask Lon Nol if he could go back to the starting point would he ousting Sihanouk and then destroy the country in civil war, long scene of Sihanouk after reading the letter staring down; end;		archival, direct (Ieng Sary)	M	political opposition, communist ideology	China	archival	urbanites, middle-class, Eastern Zone	none	FALSE	H

They are Vietnamese supporters", then various others around the woman talk about the killing of their family members and woman talks about the killing of her sister and nephew; then Khoun (higher up in hierarchy than Suon) and Suon take Sambath to go meet with their unidentified KR boss called Sister Em whose face is blacked out and who says she does not want to be "scapegoat" for the regime, Sambath confronts her with Khoun having told him that she had asked him to "solve the ethnic minority problem" and she says she got her orders from "senior officials at the zone level" but never had meetings with national leaders and that "nothing I did was my own decision", she was asked to "investigate any Vietnamese spy networks" and says "we targeted whole groups of associates" and doesn't know how many she ordered killed, when Sambath asks whether she feels "sorry" for what she did she says she "felt very sorry" after the killings but "I don't regret killing those who were really our enemies" only for the "innocent", when asked how she feels having made Khoun into a killer she says "I think we were all wrong because we followed the orders" and "we felt pity for the victims but what could we do? We had no choice", the different perps say they would accept jail only if top leaders and other killers go to jail as well; Chea speaks that at first they wanted to "re-educate them to stop" ["them" is unspecified, in general unspecified pronouns and lack of clarity in who exactly constitutes enemy throughout gives a sense of the regime's paranoia] but if they "still could not be corrected they had to be solved" then calls "them" "criminals" and prompted by Sambath's question of what was done to them he says "they were killed and destroyed [...] they were enemies of the people" (48:50) implicitly equating party and people, when asked what he thought of the killings Chea says "at the time I agreed [...] it was the correct solution", when Sambath says that "some people" say they should have just "imprisoned" them, Chea says "that is a matter of opinion" and "The country was in danger of being taken over by Vietnam"; Sambath in v-o then says that Chea even today does not trust Vietnamese and that at the time KR got close to China, and those favoring closer relations with Vietnam were killed, then back to Chea who asks "Who decided to kill these people? It was Pol Pot who made the decision"  and follows up "as for the ordinary people neither Pol Pot nor I knew they were killed"; then Sambath childhood story told by Sambath: Sambath forced to be a child slave laborer, his father was killed and mother was forced to marry KR cadre [I take this to also imply sexual violence] and died giving birth; Khoun talks about killing children and their parents at killing fields; then locals talk about bathing in the water (some footage of woman pouring water over herself) but that they don't dare drink it because they know bodies are in there; then Sambath continued forced labor story of building a dam (with archival propaganda footage) and starvation rations, he went to his grandfather who gave him food but later tells him not to return for fear of being killed; then relatively extensive footage of Sambath reviewing footage, esp. of Chea, talks about his dead family while looking at footage of Chea holding grandchild; interview with Sambath's wife who talks about his quest and the difficult family life with Sambath gone so often and that sometimes she is angry with him; more of Sambath reviewing footage of Chea and Sambath talks about how he fears of his tapes being confiscated; Chea in footage watched by Sambath talks about how they had to solve the traitor problem so that they don't "infect the innocent people lower down" and that if they had "shown mercy the nation would have been lost" [in general Chea often uses "solve" and "solution" to describe killings] then Sambath watching himself on tape asking Chea "When did you realize that villagers were being killed?" Chea says he doesn't remember exactly and "I just went on with my work and didn't jot it down" while laughing, when asked whether Chea and Pol Pot had any problems with each other which Chea denies, and Chea says when asked to chose between "individual" and the "nation" he says he chooses the nation whereas "the individual must be cast aside. They must be solved first", when asked if he felt he did wrong Chea says "I've always said, I made mistakes. I am regretful and I have remorse. I am sorry for our regime"; then archival footage of KR leaders meeting Chinese Premier Hua and other emissaries; Sambath again talks about Chea asking about Sambath's family and Sambath says he told Chea his family died in 1980s, because he doens't want Chea to think Sambath wants to take "revenge"; then Chea watching the news displaying footage of Saddam Hussein's hanging and news poses question whether constitution should be changed so that KR leaders can be condemned to death with Chea responding that Hussein was "a patriot in an unfair society" and says that Hussein showed "he was a winner, not a loser"; Khoun and Suon taken to Chea to ask about killings, with Khoun asking why after liberating the country from "US Imperialists, why fighters who have struggled - like my commanders - were killed?" and Suon following up asking at what level killings were ordered with people saying it was district, regional, or even zone level, but zone level would mean orders from "the centre" and that fingers were pointed "higher and higher" with Chea joking "in the sky perhaps?", Chea says "they [presumably tribunal] are not after people like you", Chea says he will "open their eyes" in court and "Who killed Cambodian people? It was USA and Vietnam", tells them "don't feel bad. We tried our best to serve the nation and the people, especially poor farmers. We preserved the country and stopped it falling into the hands of the enemy. You were the fighers, you should be proud", invokes Buddha "if there's no intention, there can be no sin" and since Khuon and Suon were just following orders and had no intention to kill they should not fear punishment; footage Khoun praying at temple, and Suon fearing being reborn as lowly animal for his deeds; then Sambath talks about indiscriminate arrests and killings during purges and how his brother was killed and Sambath says he never talkes with his family about their fate during KR; Sambath finally tells Chea that he is victim, his father being killed "about a year before liberation in 1975", his brother's death in 1976 or 1977, and asks Chea for his response "to my family's story" and Chea seems surprised, says "I saw only your graciousness" and now that he knows "I would like to say how deeply sorry I am"; then Sambath reviewing the same scene in his footage and says that Chea was "very sad, too" and "almost could not talk when he heard about my family like that" and says "He could not bring my father, my brother and my mother back to life. He could not talk much about that. I understand about that. After I told him about my family, I felt better."; then scene shot at night with Suon and Khuon saying they fear people taking "revenge" and thinking about "good and evil", then both mention drinking human bile, when Sambath asks how they felt about that Suon just says "I don't want to do it any more. Now I'm appalled at the idea of smashing people to get gall bladders", then Khoun says killings of Eastern Zone took a long time, 3 months, "because there were so many of them" and killings were only stopped after Sister Em ordered it at a meeting and Khoun felt "relieved" and could now return to his wife and children; then archival propaganda footage of Vietnamese fighting KR which continued for 10 years, Sambath in v-o talks about living in refugee camp in Thailand; then Chea and Sambath eating dinner at night and talk about imminent arrest of Chea for trial; then American and British newsreel footage; then Sambath says "when he [Chea] was taken into the aircraft that made me very sad, not to say he's a good man, but because we had used to work together for almost ten years, I am sad"; last footage is archival footage from Vietnamese liberating S21; then Sambath saying he bought land along border and has plans to plant trees and vegetables and wants to now be with family and "concentrate on farming the land" with last shot being of him walking along road into the distance, followed by shots of the water in killing fields	direct	Khmer Rouge cadres	F, M	threat to ideology/security, racism (against Vietnamese)			Cambodian urbanites, ethnic minorities (esp.

The Hutu perspective and the interest in the killers, often as “innocent” or equal victims, paves the way for an alternative historical media memory of the genocide against the Tutsi.

then opening sequence with archival photo of military trumpet players and marching song "Heia Safari" sung under the German command in East Africa; then male v-o narrator over archival footage from colonial empire, including hunting footage and trophy-taking, and narrator notes that there is less footage of human-hunts rather than animal hunts and this contributes to the following narrative, as v-o says, then audio saying that Maharero's Herero rose up and German farmers were "hinterrücks ermordet" and that the Herero were beaten in the "große Schlacht am Waterberge", the narrator then talks in ironic tone how after the battle "der willige Schwarze" was put to work (over archival footage of work and violin-playing Namibians) and the narrator frames the continued archival audio sequence as "koloniale Selbstzensur", followed by the audio who says that German settled in the colonial idyll and that "er [der Deutsche] versteht mit den Eingebohrenen umzugehen" and has "Obhut" over African colonial subjects, then archival footage singing heilige Nacht and the narrator says that "nichts hat unsere Gegenwart so lebhaft und so unabgenutzt erreicht, wie dieses romantisierte Verhältnis zwischen der deutschen Kolonialmacht und ihren schwarzen Schützlingen"; then Ralf Giordano speaks into the camera to audience talks about the beginning of the German colonial myth in 1919 and says this doc was prompted / provoked ("provoziert") externally ("von außen") by the commemoration of Lettow-Vorbeck who at the time was celebrated as one of the few who could serve as "Leitbilder der Gegenwart" which was then said by the minister of defence Kai Uwe von Hassel, says that the legend / myth of German colonailism is incommensurable with its reality and calls the German colonial past the last taboo and points to budding African native research which contrasts with the German myth, then proceeds to point out three chapters of the doc, the first the myth and reality of the colonial conquest, the second about the "Eingeborenenpolitik" and its legend as it still prevails to this day, the larger framework is the "Götterdämmerung" of colonialism and the "Vorherrschaft des weißen Mannes" and says that in "diesem Mosaik der Fürchterlichkeit ist unser Thema nur ein Steinchen, aber es ist unseres"; then v-o narrator takes over and talks about beginning of colonialism in 15th century with the Portuguese and their nautical exploration, then Spanish conquest of natives who are "kulturell überlegen, waffentechnisch aber nicht [den spanischen Eroberern] gewachsen sind", then centuries of especially British exploitation and brutality in India, but narrator points out that the North America's plantations spurred on the "Vernichtungskrieg" against Africans over photos and drawings of slavery, mentions British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and, briefly, German participation, points to the Kurfürstlich Brandenburgische castle - "Großfriedrichsburg" - built in Africa to protect slaving which is lost to the Dutch, shows German language sketch of slaving ship with slaves lining boat like sardines; v-o narrator points out that in 1875 only 10% of African territory was occupied but in 1900 it was 90%, mentions late entry of Germany under Bismarck shows map with 4 German colonies in Africa: Togo, Cameroon, Namibia / Deutsch Südwestafrica, and Tanzania / Deutsch Ostafrika, but also mentions Chinese colonies and Samoa; talks about Dr Robert Koch in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and the supposed success of German health care and education in the colonies, but then talks about economic exploitation with rubber, bananas, cane sugar, and coffee and the expansion of railways and roads for purposes of economic exploitation and its impact on natives; footage of German graves in Africa and narrator asks where the opponents were buried; mentions the East African colonisation by Hamburgian adventurers and colonialists with trade mostly in liquor, but also mentions German opposition in Germany, then Nachtigall pronounces German "Oberhoheit" in Cameroon and proclaims itself a "Schutzmacht"; then interview with Adalbert Owona, history professor in Yaounde, who says that in international and human rights law German contracts with natives in Cameroon were not valid and that Germany, having entered colonialism late, sought out protectorate treaties with natives in order to have legal claims over them in the international arena against other colonial powers; then interview between Giordano and Bétotè Akwa who talks about his father signing the treaties with the Germans but then the natives rose up to defend themselves leading to the first German colonial fighting in December 1884 with a telegram of German marine in January 1885 talking about having put down the rebellion; then eastern Africa with Carl Peters with colonial ambitions to become Britain's equal with v-o reading out a piece of writing of the German colonial society, founded by Peters, from 1886 talking about the right of the supreme white race to make weaker race its subjects by aiding the "Kulturfortschritt" of the latter, narrator enumerates the colonial crimes of Peters who in his books did not conceal his brutality, cheating, exploiting, whipping, executing Africans, narrator mentions the Abushiri revolt in Zanzibar / Tanzania 1888 to 1889; then first colonial war in 1888 with the sultan of Zanzibar, a Arabic, Islamic power built on slaving, and German officers under Wissmann with Sudanese mercenaries ("Askaris") and the German empire takes over power from German merchants (every new story of a rebellion is initiated with camera zooming in rapidly on two birds of prey in a tree); then 1893 the rebellion of the "Polizeisoldaten" in Cameroon, Dahomeher who were slaves and recruited as police soldiers to be used in Cameroon but who rebelled, v-o reads out SPD magazine describing and outrage over punishment of rebels with the hippo-whip; more rebellions listed with the "Jahrbuch über die deutschen Kolonien" as source with war lasting from 1891 to 1912 in Cameroon which effectively affected the entire population with the pages of the relevant passages in the book rapidly turned; then Akwa describes the war in Cameroon and hammering nails into the heads of prisoners and whipping them with hippo whip; then Owona describes the annihilation of any rebels / resisters, including their families and children, by Major Hans Dominik in campaigns in the south east of Cameroon and Owona says several 100 died, and Dominik similarly wrote about his massacres quite openly and Germany commemorates him in monuments (while we are shown a destroyed and burned forest); then Wahehe resistance in German East Africa against German colonial conquest; interview with elderly African Nkwaba [sic?] who talks about the beginnings of the resistance, archival photos of the war, colonial documents shown which characterize the warfare as pacification; footage of castles demonstrating, according to v-o, the militancy of the German colonial administration, then a geographical map with white dots indicating resistance movements and rebellions against German colonizers in Tanzania, starting with the Abushiri rebellion in 1888 and ending in 1910; then Giordano speaks to audience again stressing again that the myth is incommensurable with the reality of the colonialization and summarizes that according to the myth Samuel Maharero is guilty of the demise of his own people whereas v. Trotha is the avenger of innocent white victims of black murderousness; then the second part of the documentary focused on "Hottentottenkrieg", "Herero Aufstand" and "Maji Maji", starting with GSWA where Lüderitz' economic adventures are protected by German state, brief characterization of the inhabitants of GSWA / Namibia with the "Hottentotten" (Nama) and Herero as continually clashing but also Ovambos, Damaras, "Buschmänner" (presumably San), but all opposed to German colonisation, then major and govt. Leutwein whose statement is read saying that a settler colony is not possible on contractual basis alone and that eventually either one has to make all inhabitants equal to each other (in his demographic thinking there are only whites and blacks, not multiple Namibian ethnicities) or one has to subjugate the other, and thus, according to narrator, the conquest began with the attack on the Hottentot camp ("Hottentottenlager") "Hornkranz" in 1893 by major Francois, but Henrik Witbooi manages to escape, and this first Nama war lasts until 1894, which ends with German victory over Witbooi; then colonial war 1904 against the Herero and after poor campaigns v.

Namibia - The Forgotten Colony	1976	Sabine Katins	Herero & Nama	0	de	60		East Germany			[Produced for East German TV, “Namibia – The Forgotten Colony”, directed by Sabine Katins, was filmed undercover in Namibia in 1975. The film highlights the Namibian struggle for independence under SWAPO’s leadership, aligning it with the East German state’s narrative and criticizing West Germany for its involvement in Namibia’s illegal occupation and its ties to the German minority there. The documentary was shot by two white camera teams posing as tourists, with British, West German, and Australian passports. John Green and Gina Kalla concentrated on SWAPO and the other team focused largely on the German-speaking population. According to John Green “the circumstances, modeled on the South African apartheid system, were not conducive to filming both with whites and blacks without being very quickly rumbled and expelled.” Prior to the trip everything was discussed with Peter Katjavivi, the then director of SWAPO’s European office in London. National Organiser Aaron Mushimba acted as a co-director and the camera team travelled with him up and down the country. The project was coordinated with SWAPO’s European office, led by Peter Katjavivi, and National Organizer Aaron Mushimba, who co-directed the filming. The material was later edited in East Berlin and broadcast in the spirit of international solidarity. An English version was presented to the United Nations Decolonization Committee and is now housed in the National Archives of Namibia.]

then another man [who seems to be from Botswana] is interviewed saying before the war Maharero went to "make friends with Chief Khama III" and they exchanged bulls and that's why he came to Botswana after the war; another man says that Maharero knew about the route to Botswana because Herero trading routes went there; the Botswana man talks about Maharero's arrival in Botswana; then a yet different older man talks in English about Maharero;

Maharero became the subject of Khama III and many Herero abandoned Maharero; female v-o says that Germans thought that Maharero would regroup and attack, but eventually in 1905 reports reached Namibia that Maharero only had a small group; then a new man talks about Hereros dispersing and moving across all of Botswana and then female v-o says that many Herero communities live in Botswana, numbering 50 000 today, along the route of Maharero;

Maharero was approached by a man called Jund who was proprietor of the mines in Waterberg and Maharero was given permission to leave Botswana in 1907 and Maharero left with 110 men and 140 women and children and 116 cattle and 30 goats, acc. to v-o with route shown on map and Maharero and his group were allowed to rent farms "Nachtwacht" and "Groenfontein" there for a 30 year period and every Herero over 18 years had to work at the mines and v-o concludes that "things were looking up for Maharero" for first time in many years; a new interviewed man [who remains anonymous but is identified as Herero descended from the Maharero group at South African Waterberg] says that this brought "jubilation" to Maharero because the two Waterbergs were very similar;

then female v-o says that the Herero's lease on farms was not continued when Herero didn't show up in sufficient numbers for mine work; then native Land Act of 1913 which was first major Apartheid legislation which forbade Africans to own land; the descendant says that this ended Maharero's dream of ever owning land and so he "went back to his own culture of drinking and marrying another woman"; then WWI begins and young Herero enlist to fight Germans with a few making it back to return to motherland; Maharero petitioned to return as well but South Africans feared his symbolic return might ignite rebellion and denied permission; by 1917 the cattle herds had dispersed and now there were only 20 men, 24 women and 11 children living with Maharero and in 1919 he wrote to resident commissioner in South Africa (letter writing is reenacted with a male voice reading out what is written), but request was denied again, but Maharero decided to return anyway and he gave up his life of drink and he, at 68 years old, returned to chief Khama III in 1922 where chief Khama III died months later and Maharero weeks after that in 1923 (then doctor's certificate of death shown stating "malignant growth" in stomach as immediate cause of death); after initially being buried next to Khama he was brought back to Okahandja where he was buried among a large assembly of Herero who had travelled from all over the country (color footage that seems artificially aged of reenactment [?] of funeral shown); then interview with the Herero man who had reenacted v. Trotha earlier talks about funeral; another Herero man in English says that the funeral brought Herero together and that "his commemoration is one of the the big legacy of him [sic]. The pride within the Herero people came after his death" and recounts various aspects of Herero culture (with montage of earlier scenes, such as the dress, the cowboying etc.) and the man says that the preserved Herero culture shows his legacy as "the leader of a strong nation", more montage with earlier scenes and somewhat sentimental audio, then man talks in Otjiherero [?] and English subs "Like a Phoenix from the ashes, a mightier force and a stronger will, to liberate ourselves from colonial rule was re-born. This was the seed that would germinate into the fight for the liberation and Independence of Namibia."; then scene from beginning with woman and her uncle and she says, while touching Maharero's tombstone, that the "only way to find out who we really are is to know about what happened in the past. I have undertaken the journey I promised to and I now know about your story and I know that you came back and I know that you sacrificed your life and more for our people that enabled us to move on and to create the life that we live today. I will pass your story to the young ones that still do not know.

Mbai talks about traditions and bequeathing his farm to his son; v-o says that slowly the land returns to Herero, but many still unequal, but v-o says pressure to dispossess is mounting though violence is avoided because it has led to "Not und Elend" in "afrikanischen Nachbarländern"; v-o mentions 20 000 German Namibians still live in Namibia (with footage of white family dinner); v-o concludes that both Mbai and Seydlitz have the same needs like water and share the same love for the country and wish for the best for their children and ends on note "eine Heimat, zwei Welten"; credits	archival	German colonial troops (Schutztruppe)	M (in archival footage)	no reason given		archival	Herero	None	FALSE	H

Namibia - Deutschlands koloniales Erbe	2018	Stefan Aust, Detlev Konnerth	Herero & Nama	1	de	48	Welt	Germany	FILE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QNUYiwzCes	opens with v-o talking about Lüderitz's founding of GSWA colony which would last only 3 decades (with colorised photos and drawings) and snippets of interviews to come, v-o talks about diamants financing the colony from which Germans profit to this day, but v-o also says "deutsche unternehmer sind aber auch vorreiter wenn es um nachhaltigkeit und sanften tourismus geht" before mentioning colonial atrocities [!] by saying "deutsche sind heute wohl gelitten und umworben obwohl sie sich in der vergangenheit schrecklicher gräueltaten schuldig machten" (dramatic orchestral audio), interview snippet of black Namibian speaking in Engl. with German synchro [presumably of annihilation order] "sie [die Deutschen] wollten diesen stamm vollkommen vernichten und von der erdoberfläche fegen"; then title card; then present-day Windhoek described like a European metropolis multi-lingual and -cultural; v-o points out Germans make up only 1% of Namibian population, but Germans are still very present in the economy and then shows newspaper with interview with Stefan Fischer editor in chief of "Allgemeine Zeitung" the oldest newspaper in Namibia (102 years old) and in German, with an Afrikaans edition only 41 years old and an english edition only 10 years old; v-o then points out that there are not only German Namibians but also Namibian Germans, introes Naita Hishoono who talks about Germans dividing up Namibia at a conference 1884 who laughs and says that Namibias borders were drawn on the map with a ruler and that this for her is typical German "gründlich, genau und alle Verhältnisse gleich abklären"; v-o then comments with foot in mouth "die deutsche ordnung und disziplin der vorväter hat sich gleichsam in der DNA des jungen staates festgesetzt das ist im ganzen land nicht zu übersehen"; then journey by car to Lüderitz, with spectacular landscapes, where German colonisation began with white and German-speaking Marion Schelke, city guide of Lüderitz, talking about German trader Lüderitz; v-o then says "lüderitz kaufte das land bemessen in deutschen meilen ließ aber den [Nama] Häuptling [Josef Frederiks] im glauben es handele sich um seemeilen. ein dreister betrug der ihm das vierfache der fläche bescherte" and the guns given to the Nama as part of the land purchase became a problem to German settlers and thus Lüderitz had to seek help with Bismarck only half interested and sending colonial troops, the "Schutztruppe"; Schelke then talks about closing of German school in Lüderitz after Germany cut funding for spreading German culture abroad; v-o then talks about August Strauch who had workers who when maintaining the railway lines in Lüderitz found diamonds leading to increased settlers and miners prospecting for land and resources, as an elderly white German-speaking lady in the local museum tells us; then Gisela Schmidt-Scheele, another white German-speaking (WGS) woman, working for the local museum, while driving her car talks more about increased industrialised diamond extraction with present-day footage of abandoned diamond town Pomona the richest diamond mine of its time; then WGS Gabriele Schneider, Chefgeologin im Ministerium für Bergbau und Energie [in Namibia?] talks about the first find of diamonds in 1908 and the brief 6 years before the war during which the diamonds could be extracted [no proper mention of genocide up to this point 1/4 into the doc!] and she also extolls the virtues of German engineering and industrialization, bringing electricty to Namibia while in London the street lamps were still lit with gas; Schmidt-Scheele talks about change of ownership in WWI with money going to Germany before WWI and after to England; Schneider says colony never brought money, also talks about mining under Germans and English; v-o says diamond-income only for Namibia after independence with 10% being held and refined locally; interview with seemingly white Axel Bochert, who runs a diamond refinery, talks about his job; v-o talks about blood diamonds which do not exist in Namibia; interview with white English speaking Thomas Schrakamp who says diamonds are few in quantity but exceptional in quality in Namibia; v-o talks about jewellery often sold by Germans, WGS Andreas Herrle, jeweller, and his WGS wife, talking about advantages through Apartheid and running the jewellery business, their employees are all black; v-o says "die deutsche freude an sauberkeit und ordnung ist indes geblieben" and Herrle says likewise "wenn sie sich die die hauptstraße anschauen und auch die straßencafés ist eben der europäische einfluss sehr stark man kann auch sagen nach wie wir im vergleich mit anderen ländern in afrika ist ziemlich ordentlich" (some archival photos of neat colonial railway lines shown, without the slave-laborers that built it) and argues for the continued domination of whites in Namibia, saying "die infrastruktur wurde zum großen teil davon der deutschen kolonialregierung schon gelegt. Das waren die fundamente Namibias an sich. Ich glaube, das sieht auch jeder in Namibia so und daher ist das eigentlich normal, dass wir deutschsprachigen aber auch afrikaans-sprachigen doch sehr stark hier vertreten sind und und ist auch gerne bleiben wollen"; then drive to the largest private 215 000 hectar large nature reserve run by Albi Brückner for high-end "sanften Tourismus", Brückner's son Stephan Brückner, another WGS, talks about his father having bought the land and used it for tourism; then balloon wildlife tours with tourists and main balloon operator all white; Brückner talks about sustainability of his enterprise with v-o claiming that the growth is distributed among society..; v-o says "dass es dinge gibt die auch für einen geschäftsmann nicht im gewinn und verlustrechnungen abzubilden sind war das vermächtnis von albi brückner an seinen sohn" and son then claims his father was an early philanthropist with investing half his money into nature; v-o then says "die suche nach deutschen spuren führt uns weiter nach norden" [German traces left in the corpses strewn about around Waterberg, of course, are left unmentioned] and shows some of the largest dunes on earth in orange up to 380 m high; then onwards to Swakopmünd the most German of all Namibian towns, acc. to v-o, where 5% of population has German origins, with former mayor and WGS Hans-Dieter Göthje talking about deportations of Germans after WWII and talks about Germanness of Swakopmünd; then v-o talks about GDR supporting SWAPO independence fighters, first atrocity pictures shown are those of South African attack on the Angolan camp in Cassinga with 400 children being sent to GDR after the atrocity; back to Naita Hishoono who works towards increased democracy in Namibia, born in Namibia, grown up in GDR, studied in Austria, talking about feeling German as a teenager but German-Namibians saying that she was black and thus not German; only at minute 35 of 48 (i.e. 73% into the doc) does the v-o finally mention the genocide "die kolonialzeit dauerte gerade mal 30 jahre [an odd but frequent refrain in this doc] trotzdem ist die geschichte deutschlands und die namibias über mehr als ein jahrhundert so eng verwoben, dass die definitionen von heimat oder volkszugehörigkeit völlig verschwimmen. So unterscheidet sich auch die wahrnehmung und interpretation jenes ereignisses das als dunkelstes kapitel in der geschichte beider länder gilt: die schlacht am waterberg und deren folgen"; then Göthje at the Marine memorial, erected in 1980, commemorating the marines that died in the war against the Herero (while he talks some violent cartoonish drawings of supposed Herero atrocities by the coffee company Aecht Franck are shown), he briefly describes the battle at the Waterberg and says both sides thought they'd lost the battle, but the next morning the Herero withdrew; v-o states "für den glorreichen sieg werden die deutschen schutztruppen bis heute mitten in swakopmund geehrt. das schicksal der herero hingegen ist erst 2004 zum thema [that is thema in Dtl! it's been a topic much longer among the Herero and Nama] geworden als die damalige entwicklungshilfeministerin wieczorek-zeul die herero um vergebung bat" (some photos of imprisoned Herero); Göthje continues and says that "Lager" were "eingerichtet" which were administered partially by military and partially by missionaries, then says "die tragik war, dass es im ganzen land nicht genug lebensmittel gaben man wusste auch nicht um vitamin c" and therefore "so sind in den Lagern sehr viel Insassen umgekommen" by diseases; then Vekuii Rukoro, captioned as "Häuptling der Herero", says in Engl with German synchro "die deutschen kamen her und haben es schriftlich festgehalten, was sie noch nicht einmal mit den juden getan haben, wie gesagt, ein schriftlicher befehl: wir wollen diesen stamm vollkommen vernichten und von der erdoberfläche fegen. Die Herero und die Namas. Und dann haben sie ihre truppen und soldaten losgeschickt um das tatsächlich umzusetzen. Das resultat: 80 prozent meines volkes sind vernichtet 50 prozent der Nama sind vernichtet" which makes him the first person in the documentary to mention the Nama; then v-o with written intertitle and photo of Trotha reads out the extermination order against Herero; Göthje interprets the order as intent to take no prisoners and that soldiers were to shoot above the heads of Herero; Rukoro in contrast says his people were decimated and their lands was taken away; Göthje claims there are "viele Debatten dadrüber ob es Völkermord war oder nicht"; Rukoro says that the speculation about whether or not it was "geplanter Völkermord" "erübrigen sich" because the order exists in writing for the first time in history and the extermination was carried out, also points out that Armenian genocide and Holocaust came later which Germany recognises; Göthje says "einen Vergleich kann man nicht, kann man überhaupt nicht anstellen. Das hat überhaupt nichts miteinander zu tun", negates once more; Rukoro says if they don't get reparations they may have to take back their land; v-o says "die drohung wird in namibia durchaus ernst genommen" and says "es sind mehrheitlich deutsche die es [das Land] als farmer oder touristik unternehmer nutzen" (over footage of Jeep driving through desert), then v-o changes topics "eine fahrt durch die dünen von sandwich harbor [...] ist ein einmaliges abenteuer und lockt jährlich tausende touristen an" with unnamed male GSW talking about pelicans and flamingos found (with footage of animals etc); then drive to Otjiwarongo which "auf Herero" means the location of fat cattle, v-o mentions that first German settlers went there in 1900 when Herero and a few Damara lived there and it was here that the Herero uprising began and states "die großen farmen der umgebung werden von deutschen betrieben und stehen auf ehemaligen Hereroland, doch darüber will zurzeit kein Farmer offen reden, die Drohungen des Hererohäuplings Rukoro, die Verhandlungen der Deutschen mit der namibischen Regierung, eine anhängige Entschädigungsklage in New York, die Lage ist angespannt, da hilft nur Schweigen und Beten" claims v-o with shots of a church attended entirely by GSW; then interview with pastor Sebastian Bauer-Hoffman who says that the "damaligen Kämpfe spielen im Alltag eine relativ geringe Rolle" but shows awareness that his parish is entirely German and thus isn't confronted with the "Schnittmenge" and says that in newspapers and events the tone can be in "einer gewissen schärfe den man natürlich jetzt als demokratischgeschulter mensch nicht unbedingt so mittragen will"; then interview with parishioner Birgit Hausman, captioned as Kindergärtnerin, who says that there are tensions between several ethnicities, v-o introes Hausman's background and says she founded a German kindergarden, v-o points out that more mixed-marriages take place, Hausman then says monolingual German speakers are increasingly rare and more multilingual children exist, v-o says that many children with dual citizenship go back to Germany; then interview with Anne Nölle who is a school intern teacher who says that many children learn much about Germany and says in turn in Germany hardly anyone knows about Namibia and Germany's colonial presence there; v-o concludes "die enkel und urenkel der Herero der Nama oder der Buschmänner leben längst nicht mehr im busch und die enkel der eroberer sind keine besatzer mehr. Trotzdem gut 100 jahre nach dem abzug der deutschen schutztruppen und fast 30 jahre nach der unabhängigkeit namibias ist das verhältnis zu deutschland immer noch vom erbe der kolonialzeit geprägt" (over shots of mostly white classroom in Namibia), brief interview with some students in classroom who mostly say they would study in Germany but return to Namibia; v-o with final words "300 sonnentage im jahr, endlose weiten, atemberaubende landschaften, exotische tierwelt. Namibia hat eine menge zu bieten. Dazu kommen bodenschätze eine intakte infrastruktur und oft belächelte deutsche tugenden: ordnung, disziplin, zuverlässigkeit. das junge land ist bereits ein strahlender diamant im südlichen afrika. die zukunft wird davon abhängen wie das schwierige erbe der kolonialzeit bewältigt wird" [a remarkable interpretation which puts the burden of Vergangenheitsbewältigung on the shoulder of Namibians, not Germany] 	archival	German colonial troops (Schutztruppe), missionaries	M (in archival footage)	war (against resistance)			Herero (main), Nama	None	FALSE	H

We've been to find out why" [sic] (over photos of emaciated Herero in chains and nazi salute giving doctor Eugen Fischer and present-day footage of Namibians); Jephta Nguherimo, Herero activist, interviewed talks about Swakopmünd cemetery in Namib desert and the bodies therein and says desert refuses to bury the bodies because "their spirits are strong and they want their stories to be told" with footage of lots of little grave hills in sand; then v-o says that between 1904 and 1908 "German colonial forces displaced and killed up to 80% of the Herero tribe, some 80 000 people. Other ethnic groups like the Nama and the San also suffered grievously at the hands of the colonists. 10 000 Nama died, half their population, as well as an unknown number of San. This was the first genocide of the 20th century, but by no means the last. in many ways imperial germany's treatment of the indigenous people of namibia foreshadowed the barbarity of the nazi holocaust against the jews and other groups during WWII" (with mixture of Auschwitz liberation footage and photos of Herero and Nama in chains); Nguherimo talks about concentration camps and railway forced labor with people worked to death; v-o talks about Nguherimo's struggle to get the genocide recognised; Nguherimo says he heard stories from grandmother and started to fight for recognition; then v-o talks about Heiko Maas, German foreign minister, recognising the genocide in 2021 with footage of his announcement in German with mediocre English subs given, says Germany asks for forgiveness and recognises its historical responsibility; v-o then talks about draft agreement between Namibia and Germany which, if recognised, will lead to 1.1 bio Euros in compensation over 30 years; v-o says that Nguherimo and other Herero (with protest footage) do not agree with the agreement; McHenry Venaani, president of popular democratic movement, interviewed saying that the 1.1 bio is already the same amount of money Germany has paid to Namibia in the last 31 years; Nguherimo traveled from US, where he now lives, to Namibia to protest; he is then shown in front of parliament which was built with Herero and Nama forced labor with Nguherimo talking about KZ on the ground of parliament building; then v-o gives history (with photos) of genocide with Herero and Nama fighting against Germans who "were agressively seizing their land" and "in response the head of the military administration for what was then German South West Africa, general Lothar von Trotha issued an order to his troops to exterminate all Herero, men, women, and children" (with photos of Herero children) "after defeating the herrera militarily the germans herded the survivors eastward into the inhospitable omaheke desert the intent to kill them through hunger and thirst"; Nguherimo talks more about deaths in KZs and his grandmother sent to Lüderitz in KZ at Shark Island and says that his great grandmother was left to die, being too old to work; v-o says that almost every Herero "has a story like this to tell" with others shown; Nguherimo traveling from Windhoek to Okahandja "to meet the acting chief of the Herero" and Nguherimo in car talks about Herero being sent to remote areas; then Nguherimo meets chief Vipuira Kapuuo (all wearing masks); then Kapuuo in interview says the agreement is between two govts. but doesn't include the peoples who were killed in genocide; then interview with Ruprecht Polenz, chief negotiator for Germany, who doc asked to comment on this and acc. to v-o he replied that "under international law such negotiations can only take place between states not individual groups", then he speaks himself (in Engl.) saying as much and says that 10, 15, 20 groups "who are complaining not to have been included"; but v-o says Kapuuo argues that after the Holocaust "Germany didn't only negotiate with the state of Israel. It also negotiated directly with many Jewish groups", in interview Kapuuo says as much; v-o says that Kapuuo argues that there is no direct compensation for Herero and Nama and instead the payout would be administered by the Namibian govt. and in interview Kapuuo points out "it seems like the money coming is the aid that the German government already gives to Namibia" and that "now this is being disguised as if it's our reparations" and he says they need the money for themselves, pointing to the gravel road that leads to the Herero lands and that they have no hospital; v-o says most Herero live in "abject poverty" after dispossession and loss of cattle; interview with Venoveni Kaure, local Herero resident, who says the main problem is unemployment and there is little to eat and says Germans should give them money; v-o says that her children are unlikely to break cycle of poverty and govt. recently "decreed that they must move to an even more remote location"; Kaure says that her children would need 2 hours to get to school; v-o says Herero suffer not only in rural but also urban areas and gives example of Swakopmünd which is a popular German tourist location but on outskirts are the informal settlements of Herero; Nguherimo talks to local Herero Lourens Ndura who has lived here for 9 years without electricity or running water and living off foraging in city; the Ndura in Engl. then shows his "shack" as v-o calls it and shows "genocide dolls" which his girlfriend makes and sells to German tourists, Ndura then says his great grandfather was in KZ in Lüderitz and interviewer asks what he thinks about "the Germans today" and Ndura replies that they need to "pay for what they did to our great grandparents" and says "money is the only thing that can make changes. We can buy our land back. We can buy our animals" and says he feels like he's in a "concentration camp"; Nguherimo points to the patched up houses made of various basic materials and says this situation "is unacceptable"; v-o talks of mistrust between Herero and SWAPO with co-director Wende on phone trying to get govt to comment but "no government official granted us an interview"; then Nguherimo shown reading book ed. by Zimmerer and Zeller Genocide in German South-West Africa; then interview with professor Phanuel Kaapama, Herero and negotiator for Namibian side, who says great grandmother was sibling of Samuel Maharero who talks of difficult negotiations with Germans and says that agreement doesn't reference the word "reparation"; Polenz is asked why "why is germany so allergic to this term reparations" and he replies "the negotiations in our view have been for political and moral reasons [...] this was not a legal question we avoided legal speech to avoid this kind of misunderstanding and reparation is a legal term and therefore we spoke about healing the wounds which means in a sense probably the same but not in a legal term"; but Kaapama argues, acc. to v-o, Germany just wanted to avoid "legal liability"; then (white) Namibian academic Henning Melber points to war crimes committed by Germans in Eastern Europe, Greece, and Italy during WWII where local courts ruled Germany is liable for reparations and if Germany paid reparations in Namibia "these rulings would be seen in another light and then it would become really expensive for germany"; v-o then talks about Herero land in hands of mostly white Namibians and thus returning land to Herero is difficult; interview with Gerd Wolbling who speaks fluent Otjiherero owns large farm near Waterberg and whose family settled there in 1907 and lived alongside Ovaherero peoples, but v-o says that when it comes to question of land possession Wolbling denies "that this land used to belong to the Herero", and he says in interview that 100 years ago the land was not in the hands of the Herero as far as he knows and then when confronted by Nguherimo he says he doubts that "giving it back will improve the situation dramatically i doubt that one i think we have to develop the area" and invest in education, infrastructure etc. and Nguherimo asks Wolbling whether he denies there was a genocide and he replies "I don't question the harm which was done to Ovaherero people many of their land they lost almost all their cattle and they lost half let's say half of the the population" but acc. to v-o Wolbling doesn't believe that the mass murder of Herero was "sanctioned by the government of the time" with Wolbling saying that "if there would have been the initial thought of eradicating a certain tribe but there was not an intention and the relationship to the holocaust is is for me it is far-fetched"; but then v-o says Nguherimo's "next visit illustrates that for many herero historical links between the genocide and the holocaust aren't far-fetched at all" (with  present-day footage) and says his great grandmother was held here with most Herero and Nama not surviving with the dead bodies thrown into sea and points to medical experiments being carried out (with photos shown of Shark Island camps) and v-o talking about experiments of injecting with diseases such as smallpox, typhus, or tuberculosis; then Melber points to eugenic experiments, with v-o then mentioning skulls (with photos) shipped to Germany, and Melber says that thousands of remains are in basements of museums, universities, and hospitals with only a few being repatriated in 2011 (with footage shown), then v-o talks of eugenic doctor Eugen Fischer who later became prominent in Nazi movement; Nguherimo says about Shark Island that "this is our Auschwitz" and v-o says that unlike Auschwitz "there's no official recognition at Shark Island of the crimes which were perpetrated here" and Nguherimo says that there is no mention of Herero and points out that it is now a camping site; when asked by interviewer what Nguherimo would say to a Namibian German who denies genocide and he replies "nothing. We are going to take our land back" he doesn't know how, but says that he is "certain" that they will get there and the doc ends with his saying that "I'll walk straight with my head up"	archival	German colonial troops (Schutztruppe)	M (in archival footage)	war (against uprising)		archival	Herero, Nama, San	None	FALSE	H

Die schönsten Jahre meines Lebens?	1960	Peter Schultze, Matthias WaIden	Holocaust	1	de	60	SFB	Germany	FILE		["Der Vielfalt der Positionen waren im Fernsehen dort Grenzen gesetzt, wo es  um die Darstellung der Täter ging.  Als  Peter Schultze und  Matthias WaI den  1960 in einer Dokumentationssendung ("Die schönsten Jahre meines Lebens")  ehemalige SS-Offiziere  zu  Wort kommen  ließen,  die  sich  durchweg positiv zur Zeit im ,Dritten Reich' und während des Krieges äußerten, kam es in  der Öffentlichkeit zu  sehr kritischen  Reaktionen.  Dabei  lag  die  Intention dieser Sendung darin,  die Beweggründe der damaligen Täter herauszuarbeiten und die Mentalität, die zum Krieg und zum Holocaust führte,  deutlich zu machen.  Das  war jedoch nicht gelungen.  Da viele der Täter zum damaligen Zeitpunkt  noch  aktiv  im  gesellschaftlichen  Leben  der Bundesrepublik  standen, lag für viele Zuschauer der Verdacht nahe, daß hier eine Rechtfertigung der NS-Zeit eingeleitet werden sollte. Eine Rekonstruktion der Mentalität der Täter wurde auch im Fernsehen erst sehr viel  später möglich,  beispielhaft in Eberhard Fechners dreiteiligem  Film  "Der Prozeß",  gezeigt  in  den  III.  Programmen 1984 (vgl. Netenjakob 1989)."

similarly Feldmarschall Keßelring, but his negative response letter also shown, so they asked Dr. Erich Mende who had campaigned in 1953 to reinstate the iron cross as military honor who then talks about rearmament in Germany despite rejection thereof in 1949 and says that this "preußisch deutsche Symbol" should become again the symbol of the German army and says that every brave soldier will and should be honored in all the countries, but interviewer asks whether there should be a distinction between bravery shown in a defensive or agressive war, to which Mende replies that "es ist sehr schwer hier einen Unterschied zu machen" and that he believes that "soldatische Leistungen unabhänigg sind von dem jeweiligen politischen System unter dem sie erbracht wurden" and that soldiers are not "in der Lage" to distinguish between just and unjust wars and claims that whether it is an agressive or defensive war is in the end always decided by the victor anyway and says that "soldatische Tapferkeit" was "Missbraucht" under AH;

then pilot of first jet plane formation of the Bundeswehr Hartmann (he is shown emerging from plane), interviewer mentions Hartmann's 10 years of Soviet imprisonment and asks why he returned to the military and he responds that he wants to fly the most modern technology but hopes that they don't need these machines for war and rather want to explore them for peaceful means like space travel, he is then asked whether sheer capability as pilot suffices to be recruited or if other "Voraussetzungen" are necessary, and he responds that yes but for the beginning the love and capability to fly is crucial, when asked whether there are or should be political requirements, and he says no, when asked whether he teaches young recruits about the differences between then and now, and he says no; then his recruits who by now crowding interveiwer and interviewee are asked why they fly and one responds "aus Idealismus" and he had always wanted to be a pilot, another says he enjoys flying, but interviewer says that the fun might stop when it gets serious and if he'd thought about that, and the response is "nicht direkt"; v-o then says that once upon a time German girls and women "nur die deutschen Uniformen gelten ließen" and then goes to find out if that's the case still and asks two young women who both say they prefer "zivil" rather than uniform, then a young man is asked and he says as simple recruit no, but as decorated officer he would be able to "ausstechen" a civilian; v-o then talks about the military of the GDR and claims that it's their military that forced the West to the build up theirs and concludes that GDR accusations of militarism is not reason for investigations but that West Germany itself needs to reflect upon itself, comments that the "Bundeswehr wird niemals zuerst schießen" but since "der Verzicht auf die Agression nicht in der deutschen soldatischen Tradition verwurzelt ist, müssen wir fragen, woher und wohin marschiert diese Bundeswehr"; then a young man who is lieutenant in the Bundeswehr, aged 29, is asked why he joined and he says he was preoccupied with politics as a student and therefore he selected his career according to his political interest ("diesem politischen Interesse gemäß") and mentions the NATO and the fact that in the past many members of NATO fought each other before and points out that most recruits in German army are "politische Analphabeten" and that therefore they must teach them "das Wesen und die Aufgabe einer Verteidigung" and mentions fear of the East and that he knows what this means since he himself is a refugee from the GDR; then v-o concludes with shots of German army archieve with registers of the dead and stresses that the right traditions need to be passed on to the next generation	direct	SS (incl.

Powszedni dzień gestapowca Schmidta (An Ordinary Day of Schmidt, the Gestapo Man)	1963	Jerzy Ziarnik	Holocaust	0	Polish	10		Poland			["Ziarnik’s ten-minute film looks at hundreds of photographs uncovered at the archives of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes. They were taken by Schmidt, the Gestapo officer from Kutno, and left in his apartment after his escape in 1945. The photographic album documents, among others, the Nazi atrocities committed in occupied Poland. The commentary employs only Schmidt’s own captions under the photographs. Unlike Fleischer, who is portrayed as an eyewitness to the horrors that he did not openly support, Schmidt is introduced as a willing executioner of Poles and Jews, whose cruel and robotic actions did not betray any human feelings (as evidenced by his laconic labels under photographs, such as “The Action Against 6,000 Jews in Płońsk”)."

Att vara zigarne (Being Gypsy)	1970	Peter Nestler	Holocaust	1	Swedish	47		Sweden			[Testimonies about the persecution and murder of German and Austrian Roma during the Nazi era, and also the consequences up to the present; almost all interviewed survivors are men; almost all of them fluent in German] over BnW shots of Auschwitz barbed wire fence v-o [Nestler himself it seems] says that before synagogues were burning "gypsies" ("Zigeuner") were put behind barbed wire to share the same fate in the camps of death in the east ("Todeslager des Ostens"); then v-o about painter Otto Pankock who lived with gypsies whose drawings are shown; v-o explains that who we call gypsies call themselves "Roma", meaning "human"; many are fearful when they hear the word gypsy; v-o talks about 600 years of persecution, their preservation of Indian language, and other customs and cultures, that they were not allowed to assimilate and were threatened by extiction ("Ausrottung"); v-o talks about legality of killing gypsies in feudal centuries in Germany (all over painted images by Pankok) which meant they were forced to live as bandits, mercenaries, or travellers; lists possible professions for gypsies as knife sharpener, street musicians; during industrialization they began living in wagons in city outskirts because German law required a fixed domicile, though gypsies were prevented from buying and inhabiting houses (all still with painted images of gypsy life);

they were given poisoned milk and most died; then deportations and beatings; then middle-aged Romani man talks in Austrian German about the work camp and its commandant Langmüller who hit everyone, including children; man talks about his wife who was in Auschwitz, notes that she doesnt want to come out (parts of her are seen through the open door, he sits outside), then he calls out that she (named "Immi") should come out but she says she has "no time"; man then talks about end of WWII and Germans and Austrians claiming they hadn't done anything bad to the gypsies and he regrets they didn't "denounce" ("verraten") the Nazis to the Russians; man is now joined by elder woman and talks about compensation "from Lackenbach" of 14,560 Shilling from which they still had to pay a lawyer; man says that upon liberation, when he was 24, he "felt nothing" but soon after he had complications with his lungs, had a heart attack, but was OK for a while but now every year experiences some form of collapse; the woman now talks about malnutrition and dehydration in camps and being fed pig food, but says the second year in camp was a bit better with potatoes and some bread; man notes 2 kg of bread for 24 persons; then interview with German Herman Langbein (first one to be captioned) who says he was a political prisoner, says he was privileged in that "by far" he did not have to experience what most others did, and was able to see more than others and could see the mortality numbers of the different camp sections in Birkenau; Langbein notes than in Birkenau February 1943 a new gypsy camp was set up as sub-camp with privileges ("Vorzugslager") where gypsies were kept together as families, including children, but nonetheless the mortality there was higher than anywhere else in that period and that it was the worst of all the camps; Langbein found pretext to see the camp, says he became emotionally blunted from experience in Auschwitz, but says that what he saw there made such an impression that he will not forget to this day; describes incredible dirt, lack of water, children were encrusted in poop (now some archival footage of barracks), saw women suffering and dying after pregnancy, skeletal newborns; talks about caretaker who functioned as guide pointing to a postnatal woman who had appeared to have gone mad, caretaker than showed Langbein a pile of children corpses with rats crawling between the bodies;

v-o notes that non-German/Austrian Romani were killed by the hundreds of thousands without any records; then intertitle "Straubing, Bavaria"; v-o talks about barracks ("Steinbaracken") built and rented out to Roma (camera shows poor conditions, including water damage); v-o notes that children cannot keep up in school, are often sick in winter, and parents are illiterate; v-o notes that even more integrated Roma are second-class citizens;  intertitle "Frankfurt Bonames" and "Freiburg" with shots of bad local conditions for gypsies; then middle-aged man interviewed with child and wife in background who says that children are constantly sick because of highly humid dwellings, says that they typically have 4-5 children but says that there is only one bed, wife says some parents or children have to sleep on the floor; man says that he had a good job as lorry driver but as soon as they found out about his gypsy background everyone treated him worse and they didn't allow him to drive goods with lorry around; boss asked him if he was gypsy, he confirmed, and then he was fired; he tried to sue but says gypsies don't win court cases; continues with present-day discrimination, bad sanitary conditions, no flowing water, polluted water, garbage dumps in the middle of their "camp" ("Lager"), no provided housing, small welfare subsidies ("Sozialhilfe"), when instead they need more education, including for adults; then man in suit and tie interviewed with children and young wife or older daughter standing next to him, who speaks of AH rise to power and racial persecution of Jews and gypsies, says his mother hid them in a Catholic orphanage, says in 1942 his father was taken, says he hasn't seen his brother to date and doesn't know if he lives, his voice breaks down; they had both been arrested by Gestapo who checked them for Aryan descendants, they were hidden again by their mother to avoid concentration camps, but they were caught two weeks before the Russians came, says he was 12 and his brother 13 at the time; then WWII was over and no one knew of whereabouts of his family and heard in 1946 his father and overall 29 family members had died in concentration camps; when he was looking for relatives after the war, at age 13, he was picked up by authorities as stray youth who had nothing "more pressing to do than put me in a reformatory" ("Erziehungsanstalt") next to murderers and criminals and he was beaten and forced to work; gives address of reformatory as Rostocker Weg 93, Göttingen; he has applied for reparation ("Wiedergutmachung") in Hanover in 1958 but has received response that it has expired ("verjährt"); says he was alone from 13 years on and found his mother only when he was 30, found his uncle who went blind in Mauthausen but only gets 240 DM, his own welfare subsidies, because he has 8 kids and was unable to work, were cut when he was in the local pub one evening; says currently he lives off his wife who sells things; then "Düsseldorf" intertitle, with Düsseldorf Ellert, Jägerplatz, given in v-o as location of camps for gypsies who only recently got permission to receive water supply; v-o says older people have a KZ number on their forearms, mostly from Bergen-Belsen; v-o says everyone got 6000 DM immediate help ("Soforthilfe"); v-o says they don't trust journalists who had visited them but then wrote about adventure and the romantic life; shots of railway track; older man in suit and tie interviewed who talks about child labour commando with children aged 3 to 5 who couldn't walk anymore, says it was "terrible" ("furchtbar"), they had to hold up the bottom of their shirts and the officers put sand and brick in there and then the kids had to walk up the street, if kids were dying from hunger and thirst and fell into a coma, parents were not allowed to come and care for their child; he himself says he survived Typhus and he mainly wanted to save his children, but he couldn't, and his youngest child of age 2 died of Typhus, then his other boy died as well; says now they live in "freedom" for 27 years, if you can call it that, and says that authorities treat him with suspicion, ask him for examply why he doesn't have savings, but he says that the state had taken everything; says he later received 25 000 DM as compensation for his sickness in KZ, but almost half of that was paid back because he had already utilized ("in Anspruch genommen") hospitals and job centres; Langbein again who talks about some companies, like Siemens, who were willing to compensate former KZ inmates, but only those who had been racially persecuted; says that even though gypsies were racially persecuted Siemens had not paid them, argues that perhaps there was no powerful organization behind gypsies nor do they have strong economic or political standing; then Birgitta Wolf, author, interviewed [in Czech? with German synchro] at table outside with stack of papers who says she has been working for over 15 years in German prisons and cares for prisoners; says that most gypsies she met in prison were children during the Nazi period who had gone through the KZ, many were sterilized, many lost family, many were without any relatives; says after WWII they were released but imprisoned behind metaphorical barbed wire fence with bureaucracy unwilling to grant them benefits; says that many had been stripped of citizenship by Nazis; says that most criminal acts by gypsies were petty theft, but because most were repeat offenders they were punished harshly and they could be easily deported or also that they are not released unless they got residence permission in some other country; then young man in tie whose parents were taken to KZ in 1942 and he was put into a children's camp called Friedrichsthal, attached to Sachsenhausen; he stayed there until 1943 and were then moved to Theresienstadt; after war many stayed in KZ and had nowhere to go, some older kids 8 to 13 ran away, he ran away to Poland and lived begging of Russian soldiers; says there were children's gangs who beat up individual kids and stole their things; then talks about Gross-Beeren institution ("Jugendhof") with 500 children from age 10 to 18; says children were more slaves than children, they were forced to work and there was no school; says he got to know many children's homes and doesn't remember if he has 10 or 11 convictions for illegal border crossing, stealing cheese, stealing a coat, stealing a bicycle; never got work or a passport; he was deported repeatedly to virtually every country bordering Germany and ended up in prison everywhere; Wolf again who talks about the intelligence of gypsies despite being deprived of education; says many formed gangs to survive and support each other and she doesn't understand why German institutions do not attempt to seek reparations; says "we robbed them of the opportunity to have a normal life and we betrayed them as far as their civil rights are concerned" and deprived them of the status as "equal citizens";

Nuremberg and Vietnam: Who is Guilty?	1971		Holocaust	0	en	120	PBS, BBC	US, UK		https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/programs/nuremberg-and-vietnam-who-is-guilty/	[As the American public learned of its military's persecution of Vietnamese civilians and the United States government's covert policies to escalate its military role in Southeast Asia were exposed, analogies between the Holocaust and the war in Vietnam became more direct. In Nuremberg and Vietnam: Who is Guilty?, a news special coproduced by PBS and the BBC that aired on 7 June 1971, the first major public effort to come to terms with Nazi persecutions served as a moral paradigm for evaluating America's ongoing role in Vietnam. The two-hour broadcast, anchored by Robert MacNeil, included interviews with Albert Speer and Telford Taylor— whose book Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy had appeared in the previous year — as well as a live discussion with jurists in New York, London, and Hamburg, linked by satellite. cf.

Dr W — Ein NS-Arzt in Auschwitz	1976	Rolf Orthel	Holocaust	0	de	49	IKOR television [distributed by ZDF and in ZDF archives]	Netherlands			[on SS doctor Eduard Wirths who participated in selections but also saved a few otherwise condemned to death, survivors and others interviewed about Wirths; newspaper review in Die Zeit: https://www.zeit.de/1976/39/schatten-eines-moerders] opens without any audio and shows first documents placing Dr Wirths in Auschwitz, then photos of him in suit and then in uniform smiling; then middle-aged woman, captioned as Auschwitz inmate, speaking Dutch with German synchro about how she arrived in Auschwitz carrying out selections, describes train passengers being beaten; then v-o talks about W's bio, how he is a medicine student, then joins SS because, v-o suggests, it's better for his career; then early friend ("Jugendfreund") of W, white middle aged male German, says that W was the softest and most empathetic among their group, but says that W sought to fight his soft side to become more masculine as the times demanded; v-o talks about 1934 to 1936 when he marries and has children, is full doctor and "does what is expected of him" ("tut was man von ihm erwartet"); back to interview with early friend who shakes head over W's development to SS man; v-o, now speaking in first-person, says he's visiting W's rural homelands where, v-o is sure, population also felt like the war surprised them ("über sie hereinbrach"); v-o reiterates that W, according to others, jointed out of opportunism; shows quarry business "Steinwerke Albert Wirths", still operational today, that W's father had built from the ground up; v-o now shown on camera, interviews a middle-aged male quarry worker and asks whether he'd known W, and he concurs after brief hesitation when younger; the man is asked what kind of man W was, and the man replies he was "good people" ("gute Leute") like all the Wirths; then v-o interviewer asks man whether anyone has ever talked about what happened to his son, and the man replies "no", smiles and says he has to go and hurriedly leaves; another man interviewed about the past and he replies that the past is now 30 years gone and over, interviewer replies that, however, it was an extraordinary event, to which man replies "well we weren't treated that well either" ("Nunja wir sind auch nicht gerade gut behandelt worden von ihnen, anderen Staaten") and when asked to specify man says Germans also died, interviewer asks whether he means they died in camps and in which countries, and the man says uneasily yes, but says that he personally was treated well and then says "wir lassen es jetzt dabei" and conversation ends; another man, relatively well dressed, who says only after the war was it clear what happened in camps, including Auschwitz, says that he couldn't imagine how someone as proper and fine as Hitler was capable of such things; then a women leaning out of window and interviewed who says she knew W, and says he was doctor in KZ, she thinks in Dachau, and believes he killed himself, says the inmates spoke positively about him but that he was afraid; v-o says the third Reich "broke out" ("brach aus") and that the state needed its subjects ("Untertanen") and W was sent as W-SS member to Finland where he worked hard but was sick and then sent to Dachau and then Auschwitz;  v-o asks "when did he know he was abused?" ("wann ist ihm bewusst geworden, dass er missbraucht wurde?"); v-o then introduces Hans Münch who was an observer ("Zuschauer") of selections for gas chambers and was able, as the sole doctor, to refuse participation in selections; then Münch, captioned as former SS doctor in Auschwitz, asked by interviewer to describe selections, he says that no one went to selections without having drunk several schnapps, describes the smell of crematoria, says he was impressed by the children who quickly consoled by their mothers went along with naivety; v-o talks over footage shot out of train window en route to Auschwitz and asks whether W ever had qualms; then middle aged woman, former inmate in Auschwitz with German synchro, talks about W, says he was in charge and looked the most handsome and the most German ("Germanisch") and notes that it's bizarre she focused on his looks, but that was her impression, and that W told her that she was married and thus she was selected not for extermination; middle aged man, former Auschwitz inmate, interviewed in German [in fact it is Herman Langbein who was a political prisoner at Auschwitz], surrounded by books and folders, who says that to some degree he respected that W managed to delegate worst tasks to subordinates and that he heard, but emphasizes that he does not know this first hand, that W selected fewer to be killed; Langbein then talks about Gestapo shootings of prisoners at summary trials ("Standgericht") in Auschwitz that were led by the Gestapo to which W went to interfer and select some of them for camp labor and thereby saved them at least temporarily from death, and Langbein adds who wants to be judge over a situation like that and says not I; then back to former female Auschwitz inmate who talks about hearing shots (camera zooms on her face) and talks about crematoria and trying to ignore what was happening around her; back to youth friend of W who asks why W remained in Auschwitz until the end and he says he can explain it to himself only in this way, namely, that prisoners told W he had to stay because any replacement would only be worse than him, but he also adds that for himself as theologian this, however, would not have been an argument to stay; back to female Auschwitz inmate who says that no one should be experimented on; then interview with first interviewed female inmate who says that W, when experimenting on her, was polite, then talks about another woman who was pregnant, then diverges to talk about another child living in Auschwitz which she presumed was saved from death by W, back to pregnant woman who asked W whether she could keep her child and he says that he can promise her that she would, but instead the next night she was gassed to death, and says that from that moment on she knew never to trust the SS and that they lied to maintain order; Langbein is asked about W's involvement in experiments and says that he presumes that W as an ambitious doctor was tempted to carry out his experiments on humans who were cheaper than rabbits in Auschwitz; Münch in interview says he doesn't believe it is as Langbein describes but instead that among doctors thinking was that everyone would be killed anyway and that as doctors they at least had the possibility to carry out otherwise impossible experiments now without committing a particular sin against medical morals ("ohne dass man sich besonders an der ärztlichen Moral versündigt"); then photo of naked, emaciated woman as v-o says that W, too, bowed to the pressure of the milieu, not because he got the order from above but because he couldn't not do it ("es nicht unterlassen konnte"); youth friend of W says he cannot imagine that W's father knew of the purpose of Auschwitz and that he thinks the father was a most upstanding man, if the father needed a defense lawyer he would be the man, but he would have compunctions about being a defense lawyer for Hitler; then an old man interviewed in German, captioned as W's father, looks at photo of W and assumes it is from 1942 or 1943 in Auschwitz (photo then shown in close up); then father says W told him what was happening there and that W wanted to leave, but told W to stay because W could not do as much good anywhere else on earth as there, then talks about how initially he had heard how inmates were dying from diseases, but also exterminated ("vernichtet") and reiterates again that as doctor W could do much good there; then middle aged woman interviewed, captioned as wife of W, who says when W came home one day he cried and told her about selections, she was told that she should join him because he could not last through it alone, so she and their children went to Auschwitz for about a year from 1943 on (photo of family sitting on a felled tree), says she never concluded her thoughts of what it meant to be part of it ("zu Ende gedacht, wenn du dabei bist"); then well over a minute of contemporary footage of car ride past Auschwitz fence without audio; then second former woman inmate interviewed who is asked whether everyone was afraid when W entered, but she said that she was not afraid but sought to look proper, and that she didn't see him as human only as uniform; first woman former inmate says that W was arrogant and self-glorifying and looked down on others; Langbein says that W was problematic because he fulfilled critical function in the machinery of death ("Vernichtungsapparat") but on the other hand he knowingly helped individual inmates, but also the inmate organization in the last phase ("Häftlingsorganisation") and that W knew from 1944 that Langbein was in the organisation and gave Langbein secret information; then W's wife is interviewed about when W lost faith in victory, and she says she believes W stopped wanting a victory when he saw what was happening in Auschwitz; photos of ordinary Germans marching and Hitler saluting over march music; then Langbein asks when W became guilty ("schuldig") and asks was it when he joined SS as student in 1933, but says that it's rather difficult ("schwer") and that there is a continual development ("kontinuierliche Entwicklung") and that this is the warning to everyone ("die große Warnung für Alle") that one has to resist the beginnings ("den Anfängen wehren") and that maybe joining the SS in 1933 in itself is not a crime, but that it can evolve into a crime beyond measure; then secret photos of inmate Alex shown of extermination with v-o somewhat too briefly noting provenance; second former inmate woman talks about moments spent in the garden looking at birds and saying that she had hopes that if she dies this bird would take a piece of her into the world; then first woman inmate interviewed, cries, says she can't cope with the past, she can talk about it and hopes that such horror can be prevented, but says abruptly there's nothing to be gained from the past; v-o asks himself why W remained in Auschwitz, he participated in selections, experiments, but also did good in the camps as if the bad could somehow be balanced out; then v-o talks about W handing himself over to authorities; v-o cites letter by W to his father saying that father knows what W thinks of what happened and that the guilt is indisputable ("Schuld [...] kann man nicht leugnen"); father once hoped W would take over the business, but now it is W's son; son interviewed now (young-ish man with square thick rimmed glasses and large sideburns), says he has no memory of his father as soldier; daughter (seems younger than son) only has memories of playing with him and that in Auschwitz she was told by her mother to finish her plate of food she didn't like but that when the mother left her father just ate all the food; wife / mother says she initially couldn't talk with her children about what her husband had done, later they would read books and have other sources of info but she didn't much talk about her husband's work with them then either, also because she didn't know all that much about it, but claims that he did nothing wrong ("nichts Unrechtes") and that he did much good and that they didn't need to be ashamed; daughter says that prompted by the tv crew she looked into "the book" and she says she has nightmares and she found it difficult to read it [unclear what the book is] but she finished it; when asked by interviewer about her father daughter says that she imagines that it was terrible for him ("furchtbar") and that he must have been torn between leaving and staying and that he had asked various people whether to stay or not and they all had said he should stay; interviewer asks daughter whether she imagines herself in the position of her father or whether she also imagines herself in the position of the prisoner meeting her father, and she says that she imagines more being her father, says she hasn't imagined being a prisoner meeting her father; then other son of W interviewed with interviewer asking him whether he thinks, that his father committed a crime to which he responds "no", interviewer interjects and says "I would say yes", son answers "one cannot yet fully judge this" ("man kann des noch gar nicht beurteilen"), says "one ["man"] can see it as a crime to have joined the SS" and that "one could see it as a crime not to have refused to go into a camp", says he doesn't know / understand ("weiß") why his father didn't immediately reject and refuse his position upon arrival at camp; other son with sideburns says he doesn't quite know if it is proper to defend his father, even if it would be natural ("naheliegen") to do so to demonstrate one's innocence, but he doesn't know if his father truly did everything in his power to leave ("da wegzukommen"); interviewer asks sideburn son what his conclusion was, and son says he had revised his initial opinions and says that his father didn't do everything because he remained there, but he also notes that had his father left it would have been better for his father personally but he doesn't know whether he did more for the general good ("hätte er dadurch mehr gut gemacht") he doesn't know, which is why for him it is difficult to give a final verdict and he would like to leave it open; other son talks about reflecting on his father's suicide and that his father must have felt guilty to have killed himself, insofar as everyone was guilty who was there, but says one ("man") could be there and work there in many different ways, he doesn't know how he would judge his father if he had been condemned to death by court, probably his verdict wouldn't differ much, says to him it is clear that his father would have been executed; daughter doesn't know what to say, says one can only judge it if one was in a similar situation oneself and that it is easy for us to say "I wouldn't have done it" but one cannot simply say that; interviewer asks her what she would have done, daughter replies "one ("man") can only say I wouldn't have done it" and that she cannot "imagine" ("vorstellen") to do it herself and she cannot imagine how one is influenced, pressured, habituated by such an environment; v-o then over family photos asks what happened to W and replies that he was arrested in September 1945 after W handed himself in to British authorities, interrogator noted down after first interrogation that "now I gave my hand to the person who as local doctor ["Standortarzt"] co-responsible ["mitverantwortlich"] for the deaths of countless people" and W killed himself in that same night; footage of W's father going into house with father speaking in v-o that W's sole goal was to come home but he told W not to because he could do so much good "there" but that "he had to become guilty doing so" ("er musste aber schuldig werden dabei");

chapter "Die Lauer" describes anti-Jewish legislation (with a witness statement being read over images of benches inscribed with "Für Arier") and talks about conflicting ideas of emigration or defiance among German Jews, and shows some Riefenstahl Olympia footage of a burning shadowy woman about which the commentator asks rhetorically "gibt es eine krassere Vorausschau der Menschenverbrennungen in wenigen Jahren als diese Bilder" [the issue with such flat metaphors is of course that Riefenstahl was displaying the idealised Arier hier] then followed by the olympics in Berlin and then German army entering Austria then invasion of Czechoslovakia; "Die Bedrohung" begins with assassination of ambassador in Paris by Jews used for Nazi propaganda followed by pogrom of Kristallnacht and 26 000 Jews being arrested and put in KZs; "Die Flucht" describes Jews fleeing abroad and European countries opening borders with footage of Jews arriving in France and some British reportage of Jews arriving in UK and a final, eery, US report of Germany's neighbors Hitler might invade and lists of their then threatened Jewish population; "Der Hass" begins with Hitler in Vienna as someone who could compensate his "Minderwertigkeitskomplexe" through his reading of antisemtism -- but commentator points out that the anti-semitism of a single fanatic would not have led to the catastrophe if it wasn't for his popular following and the spreading of "kleinbürgerlichen Antisemitismus" in Germany which is then followed by footage of opening of "Ewige Jude" exhibition in Vienna and then similiar exhibition in France, then images from film eternal jew itself, and finally hitler's "prophesy" speech of "Vernichtung der jüdischen Rasse in Europa" in case of another world war;

"Die Panik" returns to western Jews who are trying to flee to Shanghai, Australia, and Palestine; "Die Villa" about the Wannsee conference and describes the contrast between the idyllic villa and the "Hölle" which is being planned there;

"Der Mörder" with footage of Himmler of Soviet POWs in Minsk and commentator mentions that 3.7 mio will die (but does not mention Wehrmacht's responsibility for them and rather the images of Himmler with POWs suggest that it's him and SS who are responsible) over which the commentator then reads the famous lines from Himmler's Posen speech followed by Liepaja images of Einsatzgruppen and secret partisan footage of mother being separated from child as well as several photos of "Aktionen"; "Der Transport" quotes Wannsee conference decision of "durchkämmen" of Europe from East to West followed by witness testimony being read (as usual by female voice that is predominantly, though not exclusively, used for these purposes) over what commentator claims is the only surviving footage of a Jewish transport that is shown quite extensively (a tendency in the film) without commentary for a while and then photos of arrival and "Selection" in Auschwitz (those taken by SS man); "Das Lager" opens with barbed wires and then corpses hanging in it, followed by aerial footage of Auschwitz and then liberation footage with some food dispensation staged for the camera, then followed by photos of hanging torture and "Apell", then signed testimony of Höß being read over images of gas chambers (though not those of Auschwitz, of course); "Die Opfer" starts with piles of corpses and a list of KZs being read out and commentator appeals to listen to the "Stimme der Vernunft" and to remember the victims; perps overall shown very little and only motive is antisemitism 	archival	SS	None	racism		archival	Jews	none	FALSE	H		Oscar nominated, Bayerischer Filmpreis

expert witness says that between 300 000 and 400 000 humans were once interned at some point but number killed not clear; for the next 20-30 minutes survivors describe the circumstances in camp in detail;

then family photo of couple shown and v-o says Franz fought for Germany in WWI but "his life and beliefs were transformed"; then Annemarie, the eldest Kusserow child, now aged 78, chronicling her parents' lives, v-o continues saying that parents were both protestant but chance encounter of Jehova's witness transformed their believes and they became full-time missionaries for Jehova's witnesses; then interview with Kusserow child Magdalena about the family home and she talks (in Engl.) about childhood memories; then Hans-Werner, also a Kusserow child, enters former childhood home together with v-o narrator, talks about his own childhood in German with Engl synchro; then Annemarie who talks in Engl; then Paul-Gerhard Kusserow, also a child, talks in German with Engl synchro about his school day and about how they refused to salute the flag or refused the Hitler greeting; Magdalena also talks about being threatened by teacher to say Heil Hitler but refusing because her dad says it means salvation comes from Hitler and that goes against their beliefs; family photos shown and v-o says parents taught children music and read the bible with them with background audio of classical music with 2 violins and 2 pianos and this is then revealed as a live scene of the present-day Kusserow children playing together [one violin horribly out of tune]; v-o says (over family photos being shown) that the Kusserows "then and now firmly believed the Creed of the Jehovah's Witnesses that our world now influenced by Satan will soon be transformed into the 1000 year reign of Christ promised in the Bible" (family music continues in background); Annemarie speaks about her own missionary work; v-o says most of the proselytizing materials came from the headquarters in NYC, but AH saw Jehova's witnesses as rival ideology, despite their small number of 20 000 in Germany; the present-day children show hiding spots for their literature in the house, the demonstration is led by Waltraud who says (in German with Engl subs) police came 16 to 18 times to their house but didn't find the books; Magdalena talks about being denounced by some man from outside of town; Annemarie then says her mother was first arrested in 1936 and v-o adds that hundreds of Jehova's witnesses were arrested by the Gestapo; then another family photo from 1937, the last complete one, and later in that year the son Siegfried "died in a swimming accident" and this was the beginning of the end; v-o says "communists, gypsies, homosexuals, dissidents, the handicapped, and above all the Jews were hunted down", shows memorial to the Jews in Bad Lippspringe; then v-o returns to the persecution of Jehova's witnesses and says family was imprisoned in town; then Hans-Werner talks about a day when he, being sick, and some of his siblings were taken by police, narrative is taken up by Paul-Gerhard and says they were all brought to Dorsten into the "Erziehungsheim" (education / correctional home) and there when asked to do the Hitler greeting and they refused they were beaten; v-o says that Annemarie and Waltraud, the two eldest, "escaped surveillance and left to find jobs in Berlin" and says "it was more difficult for their brothers", esp. when Wilhelm refused military service in 1939 and was thrown into jail (his letter is read out by different male v-o); v-o says "as predominantly Aryan Germans Jehovah's Witnesses were sometimes allowed the privilege of a Nazi trial"; then photo of Wilhelm's lawyer with his letter to family read out by a v-o voice and telling family of death sentence for their son and his eventual execution, followed by footage of Annemarie reading letter, and then footage of brother's obituary which, as v-o also comments, claims that Wilhelm "had died a hero's death fighting for Hitler"; Waltraud talks about collecting bullet-riddled body of brother and burying him, and Annemarie talks about police surveillance at funeral with brother Karl giving a speech; v-o then talks about Karl who was tortured in Dachau and Sachsenhausen KZs and in 1941 the parents as well as their daughters Magdalena and Hildegard were arrested and sent to Ravensbrück KZ and v-o points out that Jews wore a yellow star whereas Jehova's witnesses a purple triangle; then Magdalena talks about time in KZ; v-o says that Jehova's witnesses "fared better than many prisoners. Absolute conviction in their faith and strict discipline helped their morale"; v-o then talks about brother Wolfgang who was also drafted and refused -- with a letter of his read out loud wherein he states that he believes if Jesus were alive he would be persecuted as well -- and was beheaded in 1942 as v-o says and his last letter is read out wherein he states he believes the family will one day be united again [presumably in the afterlife]; then Waltraud who had found work in flowershop in Berlin, shown in present-day in flowershop buying flowers, but refused the Hitler salute to customers and was arrested and imprisoned in Paderborn and forced to make ammunition;  she is interviewed and lists all the family members in KZ, in prison, or dead; v-o says that by 1944 only one family member was free: Annemarie who was still in Berlin; Annemarie talks about holding "Bible study" every day, but eventually being denounced and arrested; but v-o says "yet they [Jehova's witnesses] had a lifeline. Unlike all other prisoners Jehovah's Witnesses could secure their release simply by signing a declaration that they'd abandon their faith. Of the thousands arrested only a handful did so"; then Annemarie saying she could not sign such a document, esp. after thinking of the suffering of her other family members; Magdalena saying effectively the same; v-o talks about liberation of Ravensbrück in 1945, parents were reunited and surviving family members "rebuilt their lives" and "remained faithful Jehova's witnesses" while in Protestant and Catholic church "most church leaders had bowed the knee to the Nazis" and "the church was silent whilst millions of Jews and others died"; then v-o narrator shown in person summarising that "among the millions who perished in the Holocaust there were some 5000 Jehovah's Witnesses and yet those who survived still proclaimed there is a purpose to all this, there is a God"; end credits with audio of family making music 	none	Gestapo	none	racism, ideological opposition		archival, direct	Jehova's witnesses (main), Jews (main identified by v-o), communists, Sinti and Roma (gypsies), homosexuals, dissidents, disabled	F, M	FALSE	H

Josef Klehr, apprenticeship as capenter and nurse, in SS 1932, then medic in Auschwitz, 1965 life imprisonment; then gate of Auschwitz with intertitle "Aufzeichnungen zur Banalität des Bösen"; Kaduk talks about forced-labor for which he was "nur" the guard; interviewer asks about his drinking behaviour in Auschwitz which he supposedly took up there; then Klehr talks about smell of infirmary, then talks about spread of typhus, interviewer asks Klehr whether he felt any pity for the sick, and he retorts that with the constant exposure to diseases "da kommen Sie gar nicht zum Nachdenken"; then Erber talks about beginning of transports RSHA 1942 which were the first pure "Judentransporte" and talks about selections; Klehr in turn denies partaking in selections and merely hearing or seeing them; Erber is asked about the size of transports and he says that differed between 200 and 2000, with most transports in 1944 with Hungarian Jews, then asked about ratio of workers to killed and Erber replies 30% were selected for work; interviewer asks Kaduk about those who deny the existence of Auschwitz, but he says "es ist nicht abzustreiten, was passiert, ist passiert"; then Erber about the 4 crematoria in Birkenau, two biggest had capacity of 3000 people ("Leuten"); Klehr is asked about the poor condition of the arrivals and what he felt, Kehr replies that conditions differed, those from France arrived in fur coats, others in cattle transports, then talks about counting arrivals; Erber says in general selections were calm, and "sind nicht ausgeartet"; then Kudak asked about "Lagerselektionen"  & he talks about selection of the sick who were then sent to and killed in Birkenau; Klehr talks about "Häftlingskrankenbau" (HKB) and inspection of the sick by Häftlingsarzt (who was also an inmate) then the file went to Lagerarzt (SS doctor) who decided whether they had to work, get 2-3 weeks off to recover, or get killed = "Sonderbehandlung" either with gas or injections, interviewer asks for more detailed description of injections, Klehr replies that the interviewer is torturing ("quälen") him and then goes on to describe passive and silent victims getting injected to death; Kaduk talks about having seen many corpses and blood, interviewer asks if he ever "darüber nachgedacht ob sie selbst auch schuldig geworden sind" and he replies yes, but in the context of war ("wir standen im Kriege") and given that the Jews were involved in the war and resistance fighters were killing it was all "nicht richtig, ja klar", but adds that "wir hatten das Pech, dass wir den Krieg verloren haben", when asked about "was ist ein Menschenleben für Sie wert" he replies somewhat bizarrely with an analogy of a hit and run driver who doesn't stop and that this attitude is "auch nicht christlich", when interviewer asks whether he'd ever considered the "Schicksal" of the individual, he says "ja ich hab mir gesagt, hoffentlich geht das gut"; Erber is asked about Zyklon B gassing and people being shot at the "schwarze Wand", but he says didn't witness the latter only heard of it; Kaduk talks about constructing gallows for 12 people for executions in Block 11, says "Befehl" is "auszuführen" irrespective "ob richtig" or not, and if they had won the war the inmates would not have been in Auschwitz (or other KZs) and would have been used to reconstruct Germany, "aber es kam anders, vielleicht sollte es nicht sein" [quite incoherent, also mumbles], says "na klar war das nicht richtig, aber was sollte ich machen"; interviewer asks Erber about whether there were inmates "die den Tod gesucht haben", and he says yes; Kaduk says that if everything former inmates accused him of were true "dann bin ich nicht wert, dass mich die Sonne bescheint", but says that this is all "Rache und Vergeltung", but interviewer interjects and asks if he beat inmates, and he says "ja, das gebe ich zu, aber ich hab' sie nicht totgeschlagen"; Erber is asked about what was done with the corpses, and he says at first they were buried but the blood would come out, so they were dug out and burned, and then 1943 they had the 4 crematoria, then talks about the smell of burned bodies, says "wir konnten nichts ändern", ashes were thrown into the rivers; Kaduk is asked whether he felt any "Skrupel" at the time and he says quickly "ne gar nicht, überhaupt gar nicht"; Klehr talks about Phenol injections and talks about experiments with other chemicals until they decided on Phenol, is then asked about how injection killings were done, says all inmates were immediately ("sofort") tot from injections into heart, says this death was "nicht so grausam" as with gas and says gas took much longer, at least 10 minutes, and he saw the corpses of gassings, says it all was "grausam" but "ich meine doch der Unterschied" between gas and injections, interviewer asks if he was never "angefleht, angebettelt", but Klehr says they never did; interviewer asks Erber about Auschwitz denial, Erber says that he had ordered a book claiming that the 6 million were "eine Lüge" which also denied there were no crematoria "und so weiter" and he wrote to the "Verkaufsstelle des Buches" and asked for the address of the author and they replied the author is dead and that he should write the publisher and he says he wrote that "das stimmt nicht" and that the crematoria were there and that the crematoria were razed in the end with their metal parts going to Mauthausen in Austria and says he cannot understand why people deny it, interviewer asks how Erber would explain denial, and he replies that either they "wissen es diese Leute wirklich nicht oder sie wollen den anderen Leuten Sand in die Augen streuen, denn was mal passiert ist, das kann man doch nicht mehr wegleugnen, das ist doch eben geschehen" - concludes here with shot of rails and Auschwitz gate with credits of camera backtracking	direct	SS	M			none	Jews		FALSE	T

Alsatian "Volksdeutscher" Elimar Schneider (whose file is shown as his testimony of medical examination is read out); many of new recruits have never fired a gun b/c of shortage of ammo; Adolf Diekmann is commander of batallion which is one of the three split-up from Das Reich and meet resistance immediately upon entering Dordogne and has 16 civilians (incl. "women and children") and 2 resistance shot (with footage); Diekmann's brutality is part of a policy and we are shown the document of the order (dated 10.02.1944) which states that civilian casualties are "ausschliesslich Schuld der Terroristen" and that "Zu schafte Massnahmen können angesichts der derzeitigen Lage kein Grund zu einer Bestrafung sein", "Schwer bestraft werden muss nur der schlappe und unentschlossene Truppenführer"; photo of dead resistance fighter tied to front of Das Reich truck; Tulle (previously retaken by resistance) is retaken by Das Reich with the help of "French milita" (no further elaboration on them); 2000 men are detained, but after negotiations with French prefect 1400 are released, but 120 picked from detained are summarily hanged w/o evidence that they're part of resistance; conversation between prefect and execution commander Kowatsch retorts that "We have hanged over a hundred thousand men in Kharkov and in Kiev, for us this is nothing"; but many of the executioners are not combat tested and new so this hanging is their initiation (over footage of collaborators in east hanging ppl), followed by drawings of hangings (as is said, drawn by an SS man) in Tulle and then footage of laughing and drinking SS; at end of day there aren't enough ropes, French chaplain pleads with Walter Schmald and a few detainees are released, but 500 imprisoned in Limoges, ~250 later in Dachau, of 120 to be hanged only 21 "escape this fate", ages of the dead between 17 and 48 and only 2 are resistance; ambush of Helmut Kämpfe's vehicle and search for him by Das Reich, but then brief previous history of Kämpfe and execution of partisans and the crushing of their bodies by tanks he was involved in (color footage of execution shown), Kämpfe abduction assumed to be retaliation;

then: "Oradour-sur-Glane is about to receive the same treatment as the 628 Belarusian villages"; then images of fictional movie (introed as such) "Come and See" by Klimov are introed and shown, since there are no images of the massacre, footage is lent credibility by having the testimonies of survivors of oradour massacre read over the images; part 1 ends with images villagers locked in; part 2 opens with a brief recap of normandy and Das Reich's support mission and history of violence, then back to (fictional) "Come and See" sequence, where the germans fire upon those locked up and set fire to building while testimonies are read; SS marked 500 dead on military map at location of village, commentator remarks "a modest estimate 642 people were murdered"; survivors fate briefly described: 5 men survived (among them Robert Hébras), of women and children only Marguerite Rouffanche escaped; commentator says Kämpfe is killed when resistance hears of Oradour [but historically this is not certain]; commentator summarises that Oradour is not isolated case in the west and that after being transferred from east SS units committed similar massacres in "Italy, Belgium, AND Greece" with same methods as in Ukraine and Belarus;

"had the division [Das Reich] not paused to commit atrocities on its way north, it could have made the difference [i.e. repelled the allied landing - a bit far-fetched]. Das Reich has joined the battle too late."; more allied bombing (operation cobra) which is largest carpet bombing campaign of WWII (bombing footage shown) during which Lammerding is wounded; back to wounded Kahn recovering behind frontlines and now facing questions by SS judge after french complaints to collaborationist French govt. and a doc. by "LE MARÉCHAL DE FRANCE \n CHEF DE L'ÉTAT" from 29.06.1944 is shown demanding an explanation; resistance footage and photos of destroyed Oradour is shown; then AH footage over commentator saying that while wehrmacht generals normandy is lost AH decides instead for last-ditch counterattack, but RAF stops attack (footage of battle operations and explosions shown), Barth whose leg needs amputation is evacuated, 200 operational tanks reduced to 15 by battle; testimony by Elimar Schneider read out over images; then continuing atrocities by SS with 18 killed in normandy, american POWs killed b/c they "look Jewish"; retreat then ordered by army staff/AH; german losses enumerated in various battles: 12 000 dead +  28 000 POW + 10 000 dead again + 50 000 POW again, followed by French newsreport; Das Reich retreats through Belgium; evacuation of gestapo prisoners from Paris, incl.

Mildenburg rhetorically asks where the dead bodies from Auschwitz are gone, Kaisergruber in turn says that if AH really wanted to exterminate all Jews "don't you think he would have succeeded", v. Mildenburg again who says that for him "Auschwitz doesn't exist" and that "the subject is of no interest to me at all"; then commentator talks about Holocaust denial and that these men refuse the "terrible truth" that "the Nazis with the SS at the helm committed genocide against the Jewish people and others"; then interview with Bothe who could not deny the existence of the camps and talks about the power rush experienced by another, unnamed female guard; commentator says that many guards experienced power feelings of superior power and that many "were delighted" to become guard over home movie footage of Reichshof forced labour camp and that the "Auschwitz camp itself was much sought after"; then interview with Gröning from Rees' Auschwitz and a.o. mentions friendships from Auschwitz; then Stauffenberg attempt, Normandy, and losing at all fronts; then Oradour with interview of Guhr (who was in SS Das Reich) who claims not to have been involved but says that when partisan it's best not to rise up against combat troops who respond "immediately with every weapon available"; then mentions forced enlisting in SS from Alsace who "nothing like the others who were volunteers" and then interview with Daniel Fischer, conscripted in SS Das Reich, and Armand Durlewanger, also conscripted in SS Das Reich, who says you could "feel their fanaticism in their every move"; then mentions replacement of Heydrich by Kaltenbrunner over footage with Kaltenbrunner and SS at Brahms violin concert; then liberation of Dachau footage with corpse piles, then Bergen-Belsen liberation footage (non-color) of Bothe and mention of 3000 female KZ guards overall; then Bothe interview who talks about herself as victim, says that she had to shit on floor and wash her hands in urine, that the KZ ruined her life, that "ich war nur dabei", and that she feels no guilt and would have been locked up if she had helped; then AH death and surrender; imprisonment and sentencing of SS who are described as regarding trials as victor's justice given that allied bombing of civilians went unpunished; v. Mildenburg lists bombing campaigns against Japanese and German cities and Russian executions of Poles and asks why no responsible figures were convicted and emphasises he doesn't deny germans committed crimes but those were all punished; then commentator says it's myth that all were punished since most SS slipped through net (though doesn't mention who helped in the slipping); Heder interviewed saying that AH had "betrayed" him and that "he perpetrated such crimes that I can only see it as treason"; v.

Searching for the Unknown Holocaust in the Former Soviet Union	2018	Boris Maftsir	Holocaust	0	en, Hebrew, rus	713		Israel	FILE		8-part series; "The Holocaust on the Eastern Front": opens with modern day footage of St Petersburg and then we get to Catherine palace in the suburb Pushkin where historian Plotkin reads testimony of Jews murdered there who had often been betrayed by neighbors; then talk about the erecting of a monument to Holocaust victims there which was only possible in the last days of USSR in 1990; then some Jewish ceremonies at the memorial with singing children; footage alternates between interview of historian at the site and the ceremony as well as interviews of those responsible for memorial; filmmaker then visits town Lyubavici where in November 1941 Jews were executed; a local quasi-historian and then two witnesses narrate/recount the events; we then are shown the local memorial for the executions and the person who made it possible (a former communist and anti-semite who found his way to god and redemption, or so his story goes), then we see the local rabbi whose father was in Leningrad during the siege and when traditional Jewish baking was outlawed he organized it in secret for which we was arrested and tortured by USSR forces; they interview random Russian walking by who claims to have saved Jews back in the day and that's why he now goes to the Jewish cemetery and he shows a folder with "Righteous Among the Nations" certificate; this chance encounter is interpreted by filmmaker/commentator as a miracle like in the "Hassidic Tales"; ctd at 34 min

Greatest Events of World War II in Colour	2019	Jamie Nicholl, Stefan Thissen, Christopher Smith, Paul Lang (not credited as directors but as directors of photography and producers)	Holocaust	0	en	500		UK	Netflix		10-part series: part 1 "Blitzkrieg": explains rise of AH with financial, territorial losses of WWII and humiliation of Germans; AH is described as "rabblerouser" early; historians interviewed are German (Sönke Neitzel, Peter Lieb), British (Saul Davis, James Holland), and American (Geoffrey Wawko); inaction of allies during Austrian annexation is explained with wanting to avoid conflict and considering Austrians part of Germans; then Munich conference which gives AH the Sudentenland and his subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia is quickly dealt with; then Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and invasion of Poland (which is described with the usual images and words of Polish valour but hopeless with their cavalry); Britain and France declare war which Hitler didn't expect; French army is described as most equipped and superior army in Europe, whereas Germans are weakened from war against Poland; nonetheless allies stall and stay behind defensive lines in so-called "phony war"; Göring and generals present a plan that's destined to fail, but Erich von Manstein proposes a better plan attack Netherlands and Belgium as deflection and have actual attack go through Ardennes behind French and British armies; Germany first conquer Denmark and Norway to secure iron ore and coal; French don't believe in reconnaisance showing massive German military traffic jam in Ardennes where they would have been extremely vulnerable to attack by French and British; "Bewegungskrieg" is described as typical German approach to warfare to attack with overwhelming force and encircle the enemy; using dive bombers Germans demotivate them and disorient them and set over the Meuse river quickly and keep relentlessly attacking -- using Pervitin to keep soldiers awake and constantly attacking; Guderian (German commander at Sedan) decides to ignore superior orders to wait for infantry after success at Sedan and keeps advancing to keep momentum entrapping 1 million French and British troops in Belgium and cutting their supplies; Hitler commands to stop allowing the British to evacuate their troops at Dunkirk -- in part AH's decision is explained by his wanting to reassert authority (after German officers had operated quite independently) and in part to give Nazi-dominated Luftwaffe the "honour" of annihilating the allied forces; but visibility is poor and bombers don't hit their targets and 345 000 soldiers are saved; up to this point story was driven by commentator and historians, but now interview of British evacuated forces who speak over running archival footage; French flee and let Germans have Paris, afraid it would otherwise share the fate of Rotterdam and Warsaw; German victory over France described as biggest military victory, German army inferior in every way but vastly superior in "mentality"; part 5 "Battle of Stalingrad" begins with non-agression pact betw. AH and Stalin and quick recap of German conquests until attack; historians are the usual ones plus some new faces, American (Reina Pennington), Russian (Sergei Kudryashov), German (Jochen Hellbeck), British (Philip Sabin, Michael Lynch) as well as an retired American colonel; describe AH's battle plans to crush red army in 6-8 weeks and red army does lose 3 million men; AH had not thought about supplies so wehrmacht moves south to caucasus to take oil fields; AH sees Stalilngrad and wants to take it mainly because of its name (and to a lesser degree because of its strategic position), while Stalin wants to defend it for the same reason; AH's army splits with one part to go south the other to go east to stalingrad; Stalin changes tack and motivates Soviet citizens to defend the fatherland, appealing to patriotism/nationalism; German Luftwaffe attack is most devastating in entire war; 1 million soviet women volunteer for red army, then brief talk about role of women in army; Germans seem to have won the city, though can't move in heavy artillery because of too much rubble after Luftwaffe attack; Stalin sends general Chuikov who boosts Russian morale and reorganises russian troops into small units for close combat fighting and snipers (who are often women; bit of gender essentialising there by Pennington who believed that women tended to be good at patience and precision which is needed for sniping), whereas germans prefer artillery, space, speed, and distance; extreme close-quarter combat leads germans to shy away from using artillery; Stalingrad turns out to be a bad military decision because supply lines could have ben cut anywhere along the Volga river; Stalingrad becomes meat grinder and Chuikov seems to always have enough men, no matter the losses; 90% of Stalingrad is in German hands, but germans not prepared for winter and undersupplied, in part due to length of german supply lines as well as the scorched earth policy of Stalin; then massive counterattack of 1 million soldiers by soviets led by Zhukov on the flanks, whereas best equipped German forces are inside Stalingrad and the flanks only protected by Romanians and Italians; the counteroffensive army had been equipped with modern tanks and airforce; german general Paulus is not given permission by AH to break out and retreat and so he decides to hold out; Goring is proposing that Luftwaffe can supply the army (but they'd need 800 tons of food a day), but the airlift is a total failure; German counterattack has insufficient men to break through the encirclement and Paulus makes no attempt to attack the encirclement from inside for a two-pronged attack; exhausted, frozen, and starving german army surrenders; unique at stalingrad for german army was that tens of thousands starved to death; of 90 000 captured germans only 5000 return; 1 million soviets are lost and 800 000 axis forces are lost; then discussion of some stalingrad myths, e.g. that the flanking axis armies were weak and cowardly, when they were badly equipped and had warned the germans; AH underestimated resources and will of soviets whose resolve was firmed up all the more by the fact that germans were "such barbaric occupiers"; part 9 "Liberation of Buchenwald": in opening sequence AH is described having hijacked German politics; sequence quickly moves on to show the corpses and prisoners and awful conditions in Buchenwald; prisoners are "Jews, gypsies, Russians, and political prisoners" with 21 000 in there; then survivor testimony by Alex Moskovic; says buchenwald is not unique and that allies discover "camp upon camp"; popular historian Flint Whitlock uses the typical rhetorical question of how a civilized nation could do this -- followed by commentator asking how much the allies could know about these atrocities, immediately followed by the 1939 AH speech of the annihilation of the Jews in europe in case of new war; then quick recap of german humiliation after WWI etc. AH's first developing antisemitism, joining party, rise to power; American historian Geoffrey Megargee says that AH's message to the germans "was not centered on antisemitism" b/c he knew that this didn't matter so much for germans; interview with Rikola-Gunnar Lüttgenau, Dan Plesch, Michael Lynch; narrative of master race vs inferior race in Germany recounted; dolchstoßlegende recounted; then role of goebbels discussed as AH knew that all out war against Jews from beginning would not have been popular in germany; the usual images of eternal jew follow (despite the fact that these are a poor measure of goebbels' persuasive success, given the unpopularity of the film); then Nuremberg race laws and later further laws against jews; jewish-american owners of NYT are hesitant to report on AH's antisemitism because they fear being seen as partisan; antisemitism sweeps across europe; antisemites in US congress ensure that jewish immigration quotas to US are not filled; Megargee and Lynch interviewed saying that history of antisemitism suggested to jews that there was a limit to "how bad things could get"; then kristallnacht, which sparks strong protests in NYC, but UK and US ultimately "do nothing"; jews trying to emigrate jews are turned back because they're destitute, but ultimately it's antisemitism that drove the rejection of immigrants acc. to commentator; then Lebensraum and german invasion of poland; then targeting "physically and mentally ill", then ghettos; then "the camps attract sadists. One of the most notorious was Ilse Koch"' who hung up a piece of skin with interesting tattoo in her office; then operation barbarossa and its nature as annihilation war; then role of SS and paramilitary groups (einsatzgruppen named) for killings of jews with the liepaja footage shown; then babi yar; but psychological toll on perps - hence gas vans and finally gas chambers with their antecedents in T4 programme; describes the scaling up of extermination programme as a result of the loss of the battle for moscow; historian says that goebbels wrote in his diary that jews must pay for the loss of 165 000 men (but goebbels was not directly involved in final solution); then Wannsee conference with 11 mio jews to be killed, mentions 6 killing centers but names only Auschwitz; we follow the story of survivor (who testifies) Moskovic in Auschwitz who tells story of prengnant woman in Auschwitz who gave birth and killed the baby for him to dispose of it; meeting of 16 allied govts in London and british house of commons stood in silence (which otherwise only happens if a monarch had died), it's described as powerful symbol but at the same time nothing was done; historian says that the survival of western civilisation was at stake and to save jews meant the war had to be won; "the turn in the war" is describes as D-Day; then Majdaneck liberation described; soviet images of nazi atrocities did not circulate in west because they thought it's a propaganda hoax; then death marches of KZ inmates; we return to story of Moskovic who is on the marches and ends up in Buchenwald, and he talks about cannibailism at Buchenwald; prisoners at buchenwald resist final deportations and take control of the camp; Moskovic describes liberation as unbelievable and was then hoping someone in his family would still be alive, but all 40 other family members were dead; Patton is described as having to throw up after having seen the corpses in Ohrdruff; Patton forces 1000 germans to visit buchenwald; various interviewees emphasise it's impossible for germans not to have known; then overview over the camp and ghetto system: 44 000 slave labor camps, POW camps, KZs, ghettos between 1933-45; commentator concludes "the shadow cast by the Nazi-regime reminds us that even civilized society can descend into depravity all too easily"; historian says that there's something in the "human condition" that leads to discrimination and extermination; then finally death tally: 6 million jews and 11 million civilians and POWs; then nuremberg trial, but much opposition to war crimes trial at UN by rightwing american politicians, and US finally manages to have the files sealed at UN; then many nazis find their sentences commuted or dropped, because looming threat of USSR; US pressures other govts to stop trials, incl. UK trial of gestapo members; then slogan of "never again" but there's always the problem that the lesson was not learned; ends with message (by american interviewees) that antisemitism is on the rise on the right (this doc was made during trump era)	archival	SS, EG, paramilitary	F, M	racism (main), Lebensraum		archival	Jews (main), disabled, gypsies, Russians, political prisoners, civilians in German-occupied East		FALSE

Brauchitsch's unease at AH's orders, but ultimately he signs, as v-o says, "commands giving carte blanche to kill anyone, including civilians" and coordinates with Himmler's SS death squads, which as Richie concludes makes him complicit; back to Schulze-Boysen who reports on imminent attack [report also cited in [Mawdsley], but Stalin dismisses it (with swear words), Richie draws conclusion that dictators often disregard intelligence from "educated people" around them and that this ultimately leads to their "defeat"; then AH has jitters on eve before war, Evans describes him as a "gambler who always goes for broke"; then invasion begins with Germans listening to radio announcement of war start and Liszt's "Les Preludes" which was playing at the time; then some footage of soldiers destroying Soviet icons and descriptions of massacres; then massive defeats (Minsk) described with reenactment of USSR generals and Stalin over maps; then amidst (reenacted) German confidence on the street, Libertas Schulze-Boysen gets photos of atrocities at Eastern front [with photos also seen in Einsatzgruppen doc; Liepaja executions of women 1941, cf.

Brauchitsch is dismissed at year's end, and Richie describes his lack of "moral fibre" at Nuremburg trials when he claims no responsibility; concludes here and we never find out that v.

There are images (and montages) of equipment used for medical experimentation, for example, a gynecological examination chair. In the conclusion of the film, the narrator warns that the Holocaust must be remembered lest it be repeated. He then goes on to use the example of apartheid in South Africa as a [contemporary] parallel.

then US ships shown with v-o saying "America had given Indonesia 870 million USD" before Sukarno had kicked them out and now that he is losing power "we're back with aid" with Indonesia paying it back in the next 6 years [is this still aid then??!] but claims that 3% of rice aid "never reaches its destination" with Sukarno "behind it all" he is then described as "playboy" with 4 palaces with 6 wives with shots of Sukarno in various official and semi-leasurely settings; but now implicated in communist coup with Suharto's forces "relentlessly they are opening to public scrutiny the corruption and conspiracies of his [Sukarno's] regime"; then description of october plot with trial of Dr. Subandrio who was second most powerful man after Sukarno and claims that the trial was significant because it demonstrated that Sukarno "clearly had a role in the communist coup" [even though there is no actual evidence that Sukarno or Subandrio in fact were involved or informed] with supposed involvement of "red China's foreign minister" which planned the supposed "mass murder of Indonesia's military high command" [there's hardly enough high command to make it "mass" murder], despite Subandrio pleading innocence he receives death sentence; then v-o says 100s more involved in PKI coup are in prison with shots of prisons and then with shots of "captain Suradi" who was head of 1 of 3 divisions supposedly spearheading the coup; v-o states coup was crushed because Nasution and Suharto rallied loyal forces with prisoner Latief shown with splint who supposedly wanted to kill Nasution, then general Parman (with still displayed) "was killed by this man" with shot of prisoner, and then general Ahmad Yani killed by another, and corporal Dua Hardiono "missed general Nasution but shot his sistern and infant daughter 5 times" (with still of little girl displayed next to prisoner); then v-o describes killing of generals and buys Suharto's propaganda hook, line, and sinker and claims "terror and bestiality was a calculated part of the pki plan they even had special mutilation squads made up of girls" and claims that generals were killed by "death of a thousand cuts" (over shots of a woman and infant in prison) with "sex orgies" and "torture ceremonies" for supposed 10 USD for their work, responsible organisation is given as Gerwani with the female killers being "meticulously trained in the fine art of torture" 6 months in advance and supposedly given "four innocent human victims to practice on" (over shots of various women); v-o then claims "when the hideousness of their [the communist's] crimes were made public it triggered a national revulsion this set off the equally brutal slaughter and arrest of half a million suspected communists" with "purge continues to this day" over shots of military with v-o saying "supported by the army, high school and college student organizations seal off and search a jakarta suburb for communists" and then check for ID etc. and v-o says "if the students or the soldiers don't like what they find or meet any resistance summarily and without warrant or formal charge they take the suspect into custody" over shots of soldier holding "a kind of kangaroo court" with some shots of quite young suspected communists; v-o mentions purges "against the Chinese" with 15 000 and 40 000 killed with footage of graffiti slogans linking Chinese to communism but mentions that Chinese "dominate 80% of the economy" and refuse to integrate and claims that 600 000 of Chinese "remained citizens of red China and they did support the PKI" and says the worst Chinese pogroms are in Sumatra with a Muslim group giving Chinese 5 days "to get out" but military stepped in to "prevent their slaughter" and put them into makeshift camps with angry Chinese-Indonesian crowd including young children throwing stones at Ted Yates and express anger at America, but then guards shoot rifles over their heads and crowd dies down; v-o says "the 300 000 people killed in indonesia during the last 16 months are about a hundred thousand more than the total military casualties of all sides in vietnam since 1960" and says that "in many cases entire families were liquidated" but gives example of many surviving widows; then interview with "young college professor" named Rata "who helped remove the communists" who says, in response to Yates question that it's hard to believe with the beauty of Bali that such violence could take place, that Bali is now "more beautiful" and that "this is the duty of the Balinese people to clean their own island from the communist influence. This is the holy duty", then Rama claims that some Balinese communist leaders "realised that they were wrong" and went to "village council" asking it to "clean their affiliates from the communist people" and claims that "some of them [the communists] want to be killed" and then village council compiled list and merely asking to say goodbye to their families and pray to the temple and were then killed by sword the next day, and says that others had to swear in the temple to god that they will not be communist sympathisers, with Yates mostly interested in how the killing was done; then shots of religious purification ritual with offerings at temple acc. to Yates' v-o and then comments that "events in indonesia might be a little easier to understand that the communists were killed just for their political beliefs and unscrupulous practices however their slaughter was largely a religious issue a power struggle between communist atheism and fanatical muslim hindus and christians" and then goes on to say "the different islands deal with the communist survivors in various ways mostly by keeping them in prison. it's estimated that today 150 000 like these are locked away without formal charges. in some camps they are starved to death or released periodically to be killed by the local citizens", then shows footage of religious reeducation program at a camp at a Muslim camp, then at a Christian camp; then shows a concert and v-o claims "until six months ago most of the audience was in communist prisons or hiding from pki goon squads not only was religion a point of contention but so was intellectualism culture and free expression it was banned by the pki books were burnt newspapers closed painting music films not pro-communists were destroyed now the communists are imprisoned the intellectuals are out and they are the vanguard of the new order" and gives as example a Dutchman who was jailed in 1962 by Sukarno for expressing critical views and an Indonesian Mochtar Lubis who exposed corruption in Sukarno govt. and was also jailed, he is then interviewed and shown writing with increased determination against the communists; then v-o talks about Indonesian army as biggest army in Southeast Asia with mostly Russian equipment and now controling the economy and most political institutions and under Sukarno spending 70% of GDI on war against Malaysia because Sukarno was trying to "find" an enemy but "now under the guidance of general Suharto is finding an enemy worth of destroying" which is Sukarno over shots of military parade and then speech by Suharto; then describes Suharto as forcing Sukarno to give him powers to stabilise country, Suharto is described as devout Muslim with "personal soothsayer" and says he has only 1 wife and for relaxation he goes to hunt tigers, now "pointless war with Malaysia" is ended, Indonesia is back in the UN, and attracted "some foreign aid and balanced the budget at least on paper" and "suharto's accomplishments have been made while assassinations conspiracies plots full-scale riots daily threaten not only general sahardo personally but indonesia as a whole" and it v-o claims that he returned Indonesia to stability; then students are most riotous force Suharto has to contend with even though they now want the downfall of Sukarno; v-o then suggests improvements Suharto should undertake which are to "cut government bureaucracy by a third and fire half the army" and to "let civilians take over" and that "he has to reduce subsidies on food and transportation and prices will shoot up" but describes Indonesian politics as effectively "political suicide" then shows army and student violence against Sukarno supporters with live reporting, then closeup footage of heavily injured man then rapid cut to Sukarno at festive garden party with v-o commenting "it's hard sometimes to understand why indonesia has put up a sukarno as long as they have" then describes Sukarno's flip flopping foreign politics with various western and communist countries as supporters, then shows Sukarno's incomplete building projects with one, bizarrely, being blamed on Sukarno even though v-o states it was discontinued due to the coup, and all being described as wasted money for various reasons; we see Sanusi again getting off a bus who runs dry cleaning and cooking business, then describes the 2000% rise in cost of living, lack of buses (only 60) and electricity (only 50%) in Jakarta, with v-o then saying that statistics in the bureau "dawdle along" "but some clear facts have been established most of them gloomy but bad as things are one positive fact is known indonesia has the fabulous potential wealth and natural resources and the new order wants it exploited so they're returning the private properties expropriated by Sukarno's regime" then gives GoodYear rubber company as example with communists running the company "but this time as prisoners and at gunpoint", then says "when the government ran things [under Sukarno] they enlarged the staff built houses in schools and raised wages although production remained about the same operating costs quadrupled profits went out the window and with them a vital source of export revenue vanished" but under Suharto the capitalists can take over; then describes more economic issues and struggles in Indonesia with "chronic corruptness" [sic] "stealing" and "inefficient management" with World Bank saying Indonesia needs 300 mio emergency aid "just to hold its own"; then Sanusi's exemplary struggle to make ends meet with extensive negotiation over half a cent in food price with a wholesaler; v-o concludes that "now comes the intricate task of stabilizing this unexpected victory and repairing indonesia's ruin before the hungry and emotional country rebels against the new order" and ends on Sanusi's worries to make ends meets before concluding with Kecak footage with credits displayed over them	archival, direct	army, student organizations, civilians	M	emotions, violent society, political opposition, religious persecution (main)		archival	PKI, accused of PKI affiliation, Gerwani, Chinese-Indonesians	None	FALSE	H

Mass Grave	2001	Lexy Rambadeta	Indonesia	1	en, Bahasa	26	private	Indonesia	FILE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAWxSF3SS44&list=PLHHdD7ApFWOSrZAgMeVE-7e48UerKFqob&index=10	[all interviews in Indonesian with Engl. subtitles unless specified otherwise; "The  last  film  from  the  third  category  I  wish  to  mention  is  Lexy Rambadeta’s  Mass  Grave  (2002).  I  find  this  brief  documentary  outstanding  among  the  locally  produced  non-commercial  films  already  discussed  in  this  section,  in  terms  of  both  the  technical  quality  of  production  and  the  force  of  its  political  message.  Produced  in  2000–01  and released  in  2002,  it  was  one  of  the  first  documentary  films  to  focus  on the sensitive topic. Despite its extremely low budget, 29  the work is one of the  few  films  that  achieve  the  highest  standards  among  the  thousands  of post-New  Order  shorts  and  documentary  works.  What  distinguishes  this film  from  other  documentaries  discussed  earlier  is  its  content,  namely the live recording of two events directly relevant to the topic rather than the  narrative  recollections  of  eye-witnesses  as  talking  heads.  The  first  of [102] the  two  events  is  the  exhumation  of  mass  graves  of  the  1965  victims.  The  second  is  the  communal  reaction  from  local  people—with  some physical  assaults  and  threats  of  further  killings—to  the  intention  of  the families  of  the  deceased  to  bury  the  skeletons.  Having  these  materials, and  having  mastered  the  skills  of  filmmaking,  Lexy  also  inserted  highly selective  archival  clips  from  various  sources,  both  domestic  and  foreign. In  place  of  the  usual  talking  heads,  these  clips  appear  on  the  screen  as testimonies  and  commentaries  running  throughout  the  film. [...] Lexy’s Mass Grave also outdoes its contemporaries for two additional reasons.  First,  it  achieves  a  good  balance  in  terms  of  the  three  dilemmas outlined  above,  between  (a)  background  information  relating  to  the  past and  the  political  confrontations  of  the  present  that  should  resonate  with a  poorly  informed  audience,  (b)  the  top  political  elite’s  struggle  for  state power  in  Jakarta  and  the  massacres  in  various  regions,  and  (c)  information  about  the  global  context  (the  Cold  War)  and  recollections  of  individual  victims  of  1965.  Secondly,  the  documentary  is  unique  for  having included a substantial number of original shots of anti-Communist forces and  their  voices  (including  a  scene  of  perpetrators  carrying  a  machete and  threatening  a  victim  of  the  1965  murders).  Unlike  the  top  military officers  who  reaped  the  benefits  of  the  1965  violence  and  its  aftermath, here  the  local  militias  can  in  fact  also  be  considered  victims  in  the national  tragedy,  as  much  as  the  families  of  the  political  prisoners  they attacked.  Such  confrontational  images  are  missing  from  most  of  the documentaries produced in the subsequent years, rendering most of these films  repetitively  monological." Heryanto, 2014, pp. 102-103] opens with map of journey from Yogyakarta to Wonosobo, then shots of families in rain in November 2000 waiting for excavations to be finished in Dempeu village; then interview with local male from Wonosobo, a witness later identified as Budiyanto, who says this is the grave of PKI communists who were killed in 1965, says that people from the "camp" were sent to be killed here and that "the killers were the military" with archival footage from camp, man says he heard 21 people were killed at grave site, doesn't know why PKI were killed but says "all I know is that PKI was legal at the time"; then archival footage of PKI singing the national anthem next to large hammer and sickle symbol; then Sukarno speech about communists; interview with a male historian Pramoedya Ananta Toer who says the New Order regime was "built on the corpses of Soekarno's supporters and these supporters included PKI, the nationalists, and religious people"; interview with male survivor Sunarno who talks about New Order propaganda falsifying what actually happened; female survivor Sulami talks about murder and torture throughout Indonesia; then male sociologist expert Arief Budiman in English who talks about military providing "encouragement" for people to arrest and kill PKI; archival footage of Indonesian man telling white journalist "The PKI is not strong.

The Look of Silence	2015	Joshua Oppenheimer	Indonesia	0.75	en, Bahasa	98		Denmark	DVD	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcvH2hvvGh4	[features snippets from the NBC doc from 1960s] opening exam by protagonist and victim brother Adi Rukun, then Rukun watching a tape of perp; nowhere is fragility and contrast to youth as present as when the dad sings a song about a sexy girl; Rukun watching an American doc on the purge; a lesson in school about communist and their supposed cruelty, the son comes home to relate to Rukun what he learned about the communists; Rukun watching two perps, Abdul Rahman Lubis and Iwan Syah, go down to the river, then same scene with Rukun and survivor with survivor speaking to the dead whose peace he disturbs and whom he has not avenged; Inong, a death squad leader, believes the solution to guilt is drinking victims' blood, reacts defensively when Rukun challenges him, tells Oppenheimer not to film; killers delegate their responsibility to someone higher up; the head of the killing squads, regional KAP-Gestapu (referred to in the film as Komando Aksi) leader Amir Siahaan, and thus ultimately responsible for the death of his brother, issues veiled threats against “secret communists” like Rukun, Rukun hides his identity; the mother gives Rukun advice on how to defend himself, then cut to the killers; the two killers of Rukun's brother, Abdul Rahman Lubis and Iwan Syah, describe killing Ramli by “cut[ting] off his penis” from behind for which they even provide a reenactment with a knife “to make the scene more authentic”, regretting that they didn’t bring a machete which would have been yet more authentic, after reenactment with imitated Ramli’s screams for help, they admit “he was probably a good person”, they also state while the army provided the organizational backdrop "if the army was seen doing this, the world would be angry", and that instead the army had to “ma[ke] it look like the people exterminated the communists”; head of legislature, M.Y. Basrun, who is also one of the killers' heads claims that “the mass killings were the spontaneous action of the people” because “the people hated communism”; he, too, issues a veiled threat “do the victims’ families want the killings to happen again?” "if you keep making an issue of the past, it will happen again"; Rukun's uncle was a prison guard of Ramli's but initially claims not to have known prisoners were taken away to be killed, but then admits that a KAP-Gestapu member told him, says he couldn't protect his nephew because he was under army command, and says he does not feel respsonsible because "I did it to defend the state, so I don't feel that way" and says "the past is the past" ["the past is the past" is a recurring saying by various people throughout film] and says if he refused he would be "accused" as well, also says that communists only pretended to be religious and rushed to mosques during killings to be spared and stopped going once killings were over and follows this up with "and you blame me. How dare you!" laughs, then awkward silence; Rukun tells mother that her brother was a guard where her son was killed and she says she didn't know; another perp says he drunk victim's blood, laughs when recounting story of bringing female Chinese victim's head to Chinese store and Chinese screaming, his daughter hearing all this is clearly uncomfortable esp. after hearing Rukun's brother was victim, the father keeps saying "it's getting late" after Rukun tells them about what happened to his brother, the daughter asks for his father to be forgiven and invites Rukun over again, says he's family now, Rukun hugs both goodbye, daughter says her father is senile [doesn't quite seem that way]; silences in the film during conversations are often unusually long; Rukun's family has a ritual remembrance of Ramli, the father doesn't remember Ramli anymore, "Do you remember Ramli? Do you remember your son Ramli who was killed?"; the two killers again, Abdul Rahman Lubis and Iwan Syah, Lubis holds up book and says he wrote book "Embun Berdarah" about what he did, then Rukun is seen watching this footage; then interview with family of one of Rukun's murderers with Rukun showing excerpts from book, but they deny knowledge of what their father/husband did, then they imply that everyone around here is friends, even the families of victims and they complain that now the wound is open again because Oppenheimer is making the film, Rukun points out that all the victims' families know the killers, the sons say "enough, mom is ill", mother leaves "we know nothing", Oppenheimer shows them a clip them a clip about their father telling how he killed, one says he does not want to see this and looks away, then Rukun and Oppenheimer make gestures to leave the mother apologises, then Oppenheimer wants to show another clip, but the family again claims "we kow nothing about this", one of the brothers leaves irritated, the other one says he does not like Oppenheimer anymore; male survivor Kemat comes to visit Rukun's mother who starts ritual of remembrance; extras: Look of Silence shot right after act of killing because Oppenheimer knew he probably would have danger to his lives if he entered Indonesia after screening act of killing and his victimized friends could not have been meeting perpetrators so easily; prior making (but not screening) of act of killing also made it possible for Adi Rukun to meet the perpetrators, because Oppenheimer was in contact with the perps and had established trust, but they had not experienced the backlash of the screening; point of look of silence was not necessarily to get perps to realise and recognise their acts and guilt but to show how it fails; Ramli's murder was one of the very few that had witnessed; Rukun's family was relocated for the release of the films; Oppenheimer says to kill you need an exorbitant selfishness and an enormous capacity to lie to yourself; they had backup and getaway cars during the filming, they drove without ID, family was at airport, filming was done ery swiftly with one interview with a perp per day; Oppenheimer "Adi is a man who is trying to make people see for a profession and he's going to encounter people who are wilfully blind; Herzog recounts the encounter between Adi and his uncle who at the end look at each other in silence and Herzog says this look of silence is filmed like a dialogue, cutting back and forth between Rukun and his prison guard uncle; Oppenheimer interview in extras without audience: initial screenings were in secret and look of silence was released publically; the films are not about the past but the present; he hopes that the film acts as a mirror; says cienma is a bad medium for words, he wants his audience to be immersed rather than tell the story; 	direct	Preman, Pemuda Pancasila	M	political opposition, coercion, communists' opposition to religion, anti-Chinese sentiment		direct	PKI, PKI-affiliated groups, Chinese	F, M	FALSE?

Because the Communist Part of Indonesia (PKI) was considered the mastermind, around 500 000* people presumed invovled and/or were members and sympathizers of the PKI across Indonesia were killed, including East Nusa Tenggara (NTT)." "*Moderate estimation from several sources", the estimated number of victims in NTT vary between 2000 to 13 000 persons" (source given is The Making of Middle Indonesia: Kelas Menengah di Kota Kupang, 1930-an-1980-an karya Gerry van Klinken), "Various circles became field executors, from security to organization members & students, to local figures and regular citizens. Some did consciously, the others did it because they didn't have a choice." (over drawings of blindfolded people kneeling), "55 years later, the second and third generation of the perpetrators and victims in NTT are looking for the truth."; then title card "The invisible Heroes. Legacy of '65 Memory"; then Otemusu introes himself and esp. his father, who was a "village head who worked with the security officers" to execute victims (we see Otemusu crying) and says he cannot apologize and ask for forgiveness "that easily" and that he also won't be forgiven that easily "of course", and then talks about sharing his father's story with audience, says when little he considered his father "as a hero" because the "school's curriculum" supported his perception (icon of Jesus shown), then shows house where he was raised, then talks about how his father became village head in Baun and soldiers arriving from Kupang in Baun giving his father a list of suspected PKI which he was to arrest (shown with drawings), Otemusu says that his father "took a long breath and said, 'I can't say no, because this letter comes directly from the soldiers'" (with heartbeat sounds) and Otemusu says "he honestly said, if he refused at that time he and his family would become the victims"; then in footage in sepia with Otemusu studying theology in Kupang and talking with "Mama Priestess Mery Kolimon" about 1965 in class and he "started to feel disturbed" when Mama said that her father was a soldier and Otemusu started questioning whether "a hero would take the life of people who are innocent";  then slow-motion of Mery Kolimon and Mery introed as first person Otemusu shared his father's story with [but why keep a hero's story secret?] and as sharing story of "'65 tragedy victims" through "Women's Network of East Indonesia (JPIT)" and she calls this process "the healing effort", then she says she is a theology lecturer at Universitas Kristen Artha Wacana and has been compiling stories of perpetrators since 2011, then recounts Otemusu wanting to read about perps and she gave him her own book about her father (reenacted in sepia), she talks about her father's, whom she describes as "police officer" [not soldier] role in an execution in Timor of PKI and that he said she would have to become a priestess because he had promised a child to god, recalls difficult conversation with her father about 1965 where at beginning "my father was extremely proud to do it" and "felt like one of the heroes who saved the country" then talks about blindfolded executions with victims having to dig their own graves and he apparently had killed 11-13 of them, then priestess talks about trauma not only being experienced by victims but also by perps and their families and says that there's a "perpetrator's trauma", as they had learned from returning war veterans, she attributes her father's anger and her and her family's becoming "victims of violence" by her father to his trauma; then intertitles say that descendants of victims and perps live close to each other on NTT including friends of Otemusu, Otemusu says JPIT invited him to meeting with descendants of 1965 victims in Merbaun (where there are many descendants of victims), then we see him meet and recount father's story to two women over cocktails, mentions that several people on list just received "staple food packages" from the PKI and "didn't know anything" and that his father "crossed some names off the list", and then he recounts to them his meeting with descendants of victims and says he feels "guilty" even if he becomes a priest; then captions say that "Mega has the same dark legacy" but then talks about her grandfather being a victim rather than perp and was killed by a relative, then she talks about her father being a village official as was her grandfather and he was killed for being accused of being involved with PKI (drawings shown) and she thinks that the relative who arrested her grandfather must have been in a dilemma for arresting his relative, but also for becoming a "target to be executed" otherwise; then Mega joins Women's Network of East Indonesia (JPIT) to counsel victims with 15 victims so far cared for; then Mega visits Oma Net Markus who was 30 years and pregnant in 1965 and they both visit prison where 8 of her family, incl. father and oldest broter, were held and executed and she was hardly allowed to visit, some of the guards were former "Timorese children whom my father used to take care of" and who addressed her by "susi" (sister);

then Mega talking about importance of pristess Mery's mission and no longer concealing the painful memories; then Otemusu looking for mass grave (with occasional slow-motion shot) and he says that "I admit" his father's "fault" and "mistakes", captions say that this was the grave were Melki was forced to dance;

Journey Into Darkness	1994	Fergal Keane, David Harrison	Rwanda	0	en	45	BBC	UK			[BBC panorama, features interview with former mayor of Rusumo Sylvestre Gacumbitsi; see his trial at ICTR where he received life sentence https://ucr.irmct.org/scasedocs/case/ICTR-01-64#eng] This broadcast is from April, 1994, as the war in Rwanda is in full scale. Fergal Keane of the BBC reports on how innocent civilians have been caught between Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and Rwandan Government soldiers' conflicts throughout Rwanda. Keane states that mass killings have been taking place in Kigali. Continuing his journey into the heart of the war, the reporter visits a Catholic church in the Nyarubuye region, the site of a mass killing. After venturing to Nyarubuye, the broadcast follows Keane into a refugee camp in Tanzania, where he meets with Gacumbitsi, the man accused of organizing the Nyarubuye massacre. He then moves on to Butare, where he focuses on the prefect Sylvan Nsabimana. Keane interviews Nsabimana, showing how he has protected people from being killed by government soldiers and militias before his being sacked and replaced by a Rwandan government army officer.	direct									H		
A Culture of Murder	1994	Steve Bradshaw	Rwanda	0	en	45	BBC	UK			[BBC panorama; advert text: "Can a nation put an end to its culture of murder? Stephen Bradshaw opens this documentary with a provocative question and analysis. The documentary focuses first on Rwandan refugees crowding the Goma camp in Zaire where approximately 200 orphans rejected and abandoned had arrived after walking for 70 kilometers. Neither the French (Operation Turquoise) nor UNAMIR came to their rescue. The children, obvious victims of the adults' folly, were found lost in the fields and brought from the bushes where they had been hiding for days. Some adult refugees stricken by hunger returned to scavenge their own abandoned maize and tea fields, but many others fear reprisals from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and so prefer to stay in the squalid conditions of the refugee camps in Zaire. The conditions "defy a journalist's clichès" with no water available and corpses that lay near the camps waiting to be picked up by trucks. 43.000 have died and bodies are taken to the roads for collection. However, the truth is, most of the bodies remain untouched close to campsites being used by the international press. Another major problem is the violent and chaotic situation in which everyone is living. A culture of murder means that the law lies in the hands of young thugs walking around with machetes and maintaining an atmosphere of threatening violence. Knife fights over the food distribution process are quite common. Bradshaw maintains that the village system has moved as a whole into the camps. Everyone obeys the Hutu elders. Food goes to them first. Grain, which is desperately needed, is taken by force then distributed the way the elders see fit. Aid workers are aware of who sets the rules and the United Nations has no illusion about who is really in control. These Hutu elders, many of whom bear responsibility for the massacres back in Rwanda, have brought with them their own system of justice. They send out thugs to control the rest of the refugees. A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) official acknowledges that among the refugees they are helping there are murderers. The very same people who helped initiate the violence with their propaganda on the radio are now holding the refugees hostage in the camps. "When you have 1 million people in a camp it is impossible to stop and ask them: 'Have you committed a crime?'" Yet many of them are afraid of returning, preferring to risk dying of malaria, cholera, dysentery rather than at the hands of the RPF. When asked about revenge, Paul Kagame denies any desire for summary executions maintaining instead that "There are no reprisals.

La part de Dieu, la part du diable (Hand of God, Hand of the Devil)	1995	Yvan Patry , Sam Grana, Danièle Lacourse	Rwanda	0	fr, en	50		Canada	VOD	https://www.onf.ca/film/part-de-dieu-la-part-du-diable/	[Gustafsson, 2024, p. 76-7 "Patry and Lacourse made several trips to Rwanda where they, above all, documented the aftermath of the genocide. The first film, Hand of God, Hand of the Devil, has a distinct Canadian outlook since it tells the story of Canada’s historical role in colonial Rwanda with missionary work and the start of Université nationale du Rwanda in Butare, which was established in 1963 in cooperation with the Congregation of the Dominicans from the Province of Quebec. This is in stark contrast to the Belgian handling of Rwanda illustrated with, e.g., archival footage of skull measurements. The genocide is nonetheless rushed over. In order to illustrate the genocide speedily, the filmmakers use excerpts of “The Nick Hughes Footage,” “Corpses by the Road,” and “The Man with a Machete” footage, thus establishing the inexplicable gruesomeness and otherness in comparison to the “civilized” Canadians. This storytelling becomes even more complex by the fact that the actual focus of the documentary is the murder of two Canadian priests and missionaries who had protested against corruption and human rights violations after the genocide; that is, when the new RPF-led government was in the midst of consolidating its control over the war torn country. This interest not only shifts the focus away from the genocide, but the investigation of the missionaries’ death leads into an exploration of RPF’s post-genocide activates, where the RPF is blamed for ordering the murders of the Canadians. In addition, the filmmakers’ interviews suspect génocidaire detainees in Butare prison during the fall of 1994. After the genocide, approximately 100,000 Hutus were imprisoned, suspected of genocide, often under appalling conditions since the capacity of Rwanda’s prison system was exceeded five- to tenfold. Furthermore, the genocide had shattered Rwanda’s court system as judges and lawyers had been killed or had fled the country, law books had been burned, and courthouses had been destroyed. This meant that prisoners, guilty or not, were kept for years without proper trials and sentencing. The interviews which were conducted illustrate these appalling conditions and, at the same time, they work to undermine the RPF’s legitimacy. All prisoners, unsurprisingly, denied any involvement in the genocide, which creates ambiguity among audiences, but the voiceover also comments on this, saying that “among the ones we talked to in prison there was a mayor, a priest, teachers, and children,” thus implying that these normal-looking people could not be the same monsters who had been actively involved in the gruesome genocide. The logical outcome is that the RPF has imprisoned innocent people without trial, making the RPF, if not the monsters, then the antagonists, in the documentary." ; synopsis: Ce film décrit la descente aux enfers du seul missionnaire canadien qui a refusé de quitter le Rwanda et a vécu toute la tragédie au milieu de ses paroissiens. Trois mois après le génocide, le Père Claude Simard est brutalement assassiné. En poursuivant l’enquête sur ce crime, ce documentaire révèle les nouveaux cauchemars vécus par les Rwandais, et présente un portrait saisissant du rôle de l’Église et de l’aide internationale. Un regard critique sur le rôle du Canada dans ce pays.]												
Rwanda, l’histoire qui mène au génocide (Rwanda: How History Can Lead to Genocide)	1995	Robert Genoud	Rwanda	0	fr, en	52		France			[further info: https://www.film-documentaire.fr/4DACTION/w_fiche_film/2391_0 ; Gustafsson, 2024, pp. 69: "The French television documentary, Rwanda: How History can Lead to Genocide, directed by Robert Genoud, is a case in point. This documentary explores how the colonization of Rwanda by Germany and especially Belgium created the historical conditions for the genocide in 1994. The premise is that history in Rwanda has been falsified by Westerners and Rwandans alike, and that history was thus used by Hutu extremists to gain power and to promote the genocide against the Tutsi. Interwoven within that are interviews with three average Hutus who relate their personal experience of growing up in Rwanda with the ethnic divisions between Hutus and Tutsis. All three opposed the dictatorship of President Habyarimana but at the same time they, as well as all the talking heads that participate in the documentary, among them Belgian political scientist Filip Reyntjens, underline the fact that it was the Belgian colonizers, in collaboration with the Catholic Church, that fueled the ethnic divisions. To illustrate how these seeds were sowed, Genoud uses archival footage from old German and Belgian documentaries with the original soundtracks. These archival films are thus used as “evidence” without considering the fact that they are purely propaganda films. The implication of this indiscriminate use is that the Tutsi population is incriminated due to its leadership’s favoritism by the colonizers. The Hutu revolution in 1959/1962 thus becomes a “natural” outcome of the ethnic divisions, and the genocide becomes the natural consequence of RPF’s invasion in 1990. The genocide against the Tutsi is only touched on during the last five minutes of the documentary, when footage of men with machetes at a roadblock as well as numerous takes of corpses lying by the road is used to illustrate the result of Belgian colonization."]

Sitting on a Volcano	1996	Danièle Lacourse	Rwanda	1	en	55	ONF/NFB	Canada		https://www.nfb.ca/series/rwanda-series/season1/episode2/	[ONF/NFB synopsis: "Only fifty years after the Holocaust, the world has allowed another genocide to take place, this time in Rwanda. In April 1994, the international community sat by and watched while a million Tutsi men, women and children were massacred in the central African nation. Sitting on a Volcano, the first volume in the three-part Rwanda series, follows the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda to take refuge in neighbouring countries. One year after the slaughter, they find themselves trapped beween gangs of Rwandan war criminals in control of the refugee camps and their country's new masters, who show little interest in reconciliation. Sitting on a Volcano criticizes the international community, which continues to feed the killers in the refugee camps and refuses to acknowledge human rights violations in Rwanda. The video makes a strong case that until those responsible for the genocide are brought to justice, Rwanda cannot begin to heal itself."; Gustafsson, 2024, p. 77 "The second documentary, Sitting on a Volcano, was filmed at the same time as the previous film and is a continuation of its theme as the filmmakers follow the exodus of Hutu refugees to Goma. Here they portray the misery of the tent camps, and the mass deaths due to the cholera epidemic, portraying Hutu refugees as innocent victims squeezed between gangs of Hutu extremist war criminals and the RPF. The film starts with an interview with some Hutus who claim to have fled because they looked like Tutsis, which is not questioned by the filmmakers and comes off as a prevarication. Then the filmmaker allows Augustin Bizimana, the defense minister of the interim government, to proclaim that the RPF “exterminated its people,” that is, the revisionist theory of a double genocide.13 Bizimana was charged with thirteen counts of genocide, including extermination, murder, rape, and torture, and was wanted internationally for twenty-five years, until it was established that he had died in the year 2000. What is more, the filmmakers then return to the Butare prison, essentially repeating the portrayal of the misery of the “innocent” detainees as shown in Hand of God, Hand of the Devil. And as if this was not enough, the documentary explores the Kibeho massacre during which the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), the military wing of the RPF, most likely killed between 4,000 and 5,000 returning Hutus in a refugee camp on April 22, 1995. However, the Rwandan government’s official estimate is that only 338 Hutus were killed, and this incident is still a highly sensitive subject to this day."] v-o (over images of male and female Rwandan farmers in the field) talks about female Hutu Concientia and male Hutu Jean-Batiste in village Mbazi (South Rwanda) who have returned from refugee camps but they were forced to flee during the genocide because militia accused them of having Tutsi blood, Jean-Batiste recounts killing by soldiers who were primarily looking to loot dead victims; then v-o introes Rwandan genocide with "in less than 3 months" with "up to a million people" killed with "planned genocide" aimed at exterminating Tutsi, then mentions RPF 1994 invasion [no mention of earlier invasions], militia and perps flee to Zaire border taking 1 million Hutu with them (over footage of refugees leaving country); then title card over aerial footage of camp Katale camp in Zaire); v-o talks about Care Canada picking up bodies and 50 000 dying from Cholera in Zaire with most victims children; interview with white male Michael Marchen, Toronto policeman, who says he wanted to help and came, talks about digging latrine, collecting bodies, helping in hospital (he talks in English with footage of camps, including of naked washing children, shown); v-o points out that Cholera is less of a problem now thanks to aid (over footage of various children); Marchen says media has left and there's no more international protection for the camp, only protection is Zairian military and paramilitary who haven't been paid in 2 years and get their payment "at the end of an AK-47" which in fact happened to him this morning and says many die from them; Destexhe from MSF talks about perps having taken Hutu population in camps hostage to create a mini Rwanda and says that while aid saves lives it also reinforces "un regime meurtrier"; v-o over footage of men, some in military fatigues but most in civilian clothing; then interview with UNHCR official Chris Janowski who talks about "military in the camps" who loot camp and local populations and kill "alleged Tutsi"; then interview with black woman Lynn Gugi [sic?], a "social worker from Kenya", who says that 80% of camp inhabitants are women and children who are marginalized by patriarchal camp order and she tries to give them a voice (over footage of women and children), talks about insecurity; Janowski talks about need for "law and order" but lacking; v-o says law and order are now supposedly provided by 30 000 ex-FAR many of whom were implicated in genocide, they also use propaganda to keep population in check(footage of men going around camp with radio and loudspeakers); v-o notes that some of the refugees "played key parts in the genocide" and "they're using the refugees as currency to buy their way back into Rwanda"; then interview with [now dead as found out in 2021] former defence minister of Rwana Augustin Bisimana [who played a role in organizing the genocide but this is not mentioned, ICTR charged him with genocide and a dozen other crimes against humanity and violations of Geneva Convention in 2012] who says that FAR tried to evacuate the maximum possible number of people that the RPF wanted to "exterminés", says the RPF sees itself as liberator but asks rhetorically whether you have ever seen a population fleeing from their liberator, claims 4.5 million people have fled, says later that use of force cannot be excluded in future actions since people cannot live under these conditions forever; but interviewed UNHCR representative Chris Janowski says that they had 3 attempts to repatriate and two had to be cancelled completely, one of those even ended in violence, because it was entirely because of perpetrators and FAR intimidating camp population not to repatriate in order to keep negotiating power with RPF; footage of UNAMIR forces dropping flyers from helicopter urging refugees to return and v-o says leaflets describe "Rwanda as a haven of peace and security as opposed to what they [UNAMIR] call the death camps in Zaire"; interview with general Guy Tousignant, UNAMIR, in French with Engl. synchro who says they "screwed up"; back to Gugi [sic?] says most refugees want to return; v-o then talks about Butare which v-o claims not to be the safe haven talked about by UNAMIR "propaganda" and says RPF is everywhere and "they make the law and they carry them out [sic], often in summary fashion"; then speech (in Butare) and then interview by then Rwandan Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu; v-o says 1000s of Hutu "fell victim to reprisals", also mentions IDPs numbering around 500 000 in Gikongoro; Antoine Sibomana [sic?], former mayor of Gikongoro, goes through camp to encourage repatriation with interview with Hutu male IDP in Gikongoro in Kinyarwanda who says he had returned home but there were too many revenge killings and mere accusations and grudges could get you killed so he fearfully returned to the camp again, several other male Hutu IDPs give similar accounts and speak about their fear, interrupted by footage of UNAMIR white male giving reassuring speech to crowd that they'll provide security; interviews with Sibomana in French who talks about returning, then returns to Mbazi school (over footage of looted building in total disorder) and talks about re-starting from scratch; also interview with female former IDP, now repatriated, Concientia [sic?] who is glad to have returned home from camps; v-o says "most painful issue is that of reconciliation between neighbors"; male Rwandan interviewee in Kinyarwanda claims perps are all in the camps; Conciencia says she will try help authorities identify perps and put them in prison if they ever return; interview with Cécile who v-o introes as having saved a Tutsi in her house but militia found out and killed him and now the victim's family claims she denounced him to militia so now she is leaving; then footage from Butare prison built for 1200 prisoners but now 4500 prisoners inside with Antoine Sibomana now imprisoned as well for 5 months at time of filming already with v-o saying that every week 500 more are imprisoned "most are Hutus" and "there is no pretense of legal process. With only 14 judges inside the whole country, these prisoners risk being locked away for the foreseeable future", then Sibomana in French shows several boys in prison also accused of genocide and questions whether that is in keeping with human rights as current govt. says and points out that some have no official case against them and have been beaten; v-o notes that the filmcrew got a secret note in French with another v-o reads in English (with echo effect) with note claiming that prisoners are "slated for extermination" and talks about spread of disease and points out that most are held without legal charges or basis; interview with Alphonse-Marie Nkubito, Rwandan Minister of Justice, in French says that they cannot "bow to formality" and says the prisoners would be massacred outside; but v-o points out that more than 20 prisoners die each day in Rwanda; Sibomana shows injured prisoners from beatings; Nkubito says some people don't know how to restrain themselves; Sibomana shows more beaten prisoners; male UNAMIR representative says he hadn't heard about torture but says it's still better to imprison than to execute; footage of Katale camp, Goma, Zaire, with v-o saying that ex-FAR forced out humanitarian organizations with former Care Canada coordinator at the camp with French-Canadian white male Guy Banville [sic?] talking about situation; female Kenyan (black) Lynn Gugi [sic?] also forced out and the people at the camp she was training were hacked up by Hutu militia; other interviewees and Banville suspect new militia forces are forming for a new war and v-o draws comparison to KR in Cambodia; Alain Destexhe from MSF says they decided to withdraw because their 3 minimum conditions to operate had not been fulfilled: 1) no one was tried for genocide, 2) no international police force, 3) today distribution is entirely controlled by perps of genocide and adds that sometimes humanitarian aid has to be withdrawn if it does more harm than good; then footage of destroyed Kibeho camp with v-o talking about Rwandan govt. cutting off food for those who didn't leave willingly and then eventually RPF "laid siege" to camp with 120 000 fearing for their lives, Rwandan male talks about killings, then v-o says "tragedy strikes" on April 23 when RPF strikes the camp with force with piles of corpses shown; Bizimungu "tries to downplay the massacre" acc. to v-o and UNAMIR counts 4000 dead while Bizimungu wants to open mass graves to prove there are only 300; two male UNAMIR representatives say they can and will use force in case of systematic massacres; but v-o says [harshly] that "just like 1994" the UN troops "did nothing to stop the massacre" and that in end return of refugees led many to their graves and "still no one can count on the blue berets to protect them"; back to Butare jail with Sibomana saying he hopes those of them who are guilty will be identified and the rest released; Destexhe wants justice but says some perceive justice along purely ethnic lines; then extended footage of mass grave burial; v-o talks about 2 million Rwandans stuck between perps of "Rwanda's recent Holocaust" and on other side is a "new regime unable or unwilling to show that it is committed to reconciliation" and says that for country and refugees "it may be the beginning of a new nightmare"; end credits	direct	FAR, Hutu militia, RPF (reprisal killings)	M	racism, reprisals, looting		none	Tutsi (main), Hutu (reprisals)	none, (M, F non-genocide victims/refugees)	FALSE	H

Hand of God, Hand of the Devil, the second volume in the three-part Rwanda series, explores Canada's role in the development of the genocidal ideology that took root in Rwanda, which was considered the "jewel" of Canadian aid in Africa. This video focuses on the murder of two Canadian missionaries, killed for having protested against corruption and human rights violations. Brother François Cardinal, who worked at the controversial Rwandan college, funded by Canadian aid money to the Rwandan president's advisors. Like countless others in Rwanda, his killers were never found. Father Claude Simard, the only Canadian to have stayed in Rwanda during the 100 days of genocide, was murdered in 1994--after the regime responsible for the massacre of Tutsis had been overthrown. Since Simard had risked his life to rescue Tutsis, the Canadian government concluded that his killers must have been Hutus who feared being identified for their crimes. However, the video uncovers evidence that Simard died at the hands of the new government, upset by the Canadian priest's objections to its reprisal killings of innocent Hutus. Hand of God, Hand of the Devil raises disturbing questions about Canada's role in Rwanda. Having assisted the former regime, will Canadian aid now sow the seeds for a new crop of killers?"]

I don't think there was any justification for war" and says that Habyarimana's grip was already slipping and that the system could have been changed "peacefully" without resorting to violence; Des Forges about RPF as founded by mostly Tutsi in Ugandan exile since 1959, many were in Ugandan army and then deserted the army to join RPF, says that since RPF was Tutsi dominated "the opportunity [Hutu extremists] to blame the Tutsi population within the country seemed too tempting to ignore"; followed by headlines of Hutu extremist newspaper Kangura and the Hutu 10 commandments shown; Sibomana about enemy image being identified with all Tutsi and anyone, including Hutu, opposed to "Habyarimana clan"; Des Forges says FAR was initially small with around 10 000 but then expanded rapidly to 30 000 and 35 000 men, says French played a role in supplying and training FAR and she notes that albeit perhaps most victims were killed with machetes [or other tools] but a crucial element of each massacre was the presence of militarily armed soldiers which gave "the edge necessary to break down the resistance" and says "the use of the firearms was crucial to the success of the genocide"; footage of Interahamwe, introed by Sibomana in v-o as youth wing of Habyarimana's MRND movement/party, and Interahamwe performances and public ceremonies; then Des Forges talks about weapons stocks of Interahamwe which numbered around 1700 stationed in different parts of Kigali; footage of fire in Bugesera region 1992 with Sibomana in v-o saying that this was the start and militia was very strong in Bugesera, with Jean-Batiste Numanga read a statement on Radio Rwanda about "a plan to use Tutsi women to murder Hutu political leaders" and a week later Bugesera was in flames (with photos of corpses shown) and says that this showed the same pattern as later in the genocide with use of agricultural tools, targeting of entire families, looting and destruction of property;

Forsaken Cries: The Story of Rwanda	1997	Kathi Lynn Austin, Andrea Torrice	Rwanda	0	en	35		US			[Gustafsson, 2024, pp. 69: "The French television documentary, Rwanda: How History can Lead to Genocide, directed by Robert Genoud, is a case in point. This documentary explores how the colonization of Rwanda by Germany and especially Belgium created the historical conditions for the genocide in 1994. The premise is that history in Rwanda has been falsified by Westerners and Rwandans alike, and that history was thus used by Hutu extremists to gain power and to promote the genocide against the Tutsi. Interwoven within that are interviews with three average Hutus who relate their personal experience of growing up in Rwanda with the ethnic divisions between Hutus and Tutsis. All three opposed the dictatorship of President Habyarimana but at the same time they, as well as all the talking heads that participate in the documentary, among them Belgian political scientist Filip Reyntjens, underline the fact that it was the Belgian colonizers, in collaboration with the Catholic Church, that fueled the ethnic divisions. To illustrate how these seeds were sowed, Genoud uses archival footage from old German and Belgian documentaries with the original soundtracks. These archival films are thus used as “evidence” without considering the fact that they are purely propaganda films. The implication of this indiscriminate use is that the Tutsi population is incriminated due to its leadership’s favoritism by the colonizers. The Hutu revolution in 1959/1962 thus becomes a “natural” outcome of the ethnic divisions, and the genocide becomes the natural consequence of RPF’s invasion in 1990. The genocide against the Tutsi is only touched on during the last five minutes of the documentary, when footage of men with machetes at a roadblock as well as numerous takes of corpses lying by the road is used to illustrate the result of Belgian colonization."]

He calls the genocide an accident that fell upon us. And one finds victims like Eugenie who astonishingly still find a good word for the man who left her a widow with horrendous scars" she then talks "If he had come to me personally and confessed and asked me for forgiveness, I would have forgiven him", then v-o continues "Rwanda is doing something no other country has ever tried, asking the survivors of a genocide, the Tutsis, to live side by side with a tribe that tried to wipe them out", then William Schabas who says "this is new territory for everybody, not just the Rwandans. Nobody in the world has gone through this process in the same way as they're doing. It's a brave new world for them" and v-o concludes "in this brave new world Rwandans moove nervously into an uncertain future still in the shadow of the machete still unable to see what lies ahead" (over audio of singing and clapping sounds); end credits	direct, archival	FAR, militia, Hutu mob, RTLM 	M	tribal hatred; looting; duty		direct, archival	Tutsi	F, M	TRUE	H

Decades earlier, under colonial rule, the Belgians had used the Tutsis, Rwanda's aristocracy, to enforce their rule over the Hutu majority, who were mostly poor farmers", then Gourevitch "All privileges went to the Tutsi minority, and the Hutu majority was almost in bondage. At independence in the late '50s and early '60s, this system was reversed. The majority Hutu rebelled, seized power, in the name of majority rule imposed an apartheid-like system in reverse and oppressed the Tutsi bitterly."; v-o says " Faced with discrimination and increasing Hutu violence, most Tutsis fled to neighboring countries, where they formed a guerrilla army, the Rwandan Patriotic Front. In 1990, the rebel Tutsis invaded Rwanda and forced peace talks with Juvenal Habyarimana, the Hutu president. Anxious to stay in power himself, Habyarimana signed a peace treaty agreeing to share power with the Tutsis", then Gourevitch again saying that Hutu extremists were unwilling to share power and the "threat of peace [to them] was even greater than the threat of war", then v-o about UNAMIR coming to Rwanda in 1993; various interviews with Henry Anyidoho, Luc Marchal, Luc Lemaire (all UNAMIR), Iqbal Riza (chief of staff to UN secretary general) and more Gourevitch, interviews with victims Nausicaa Habimana (niece of Hutu moderate Lando who was killed), Florida Ngulinzira -- all these interviews with similar content and similarly narratively embedded [airplane crash with news report footage; political persecution of Hutu moderates; images of corpses at roadblocks; Hughes footage of killing] in When Good Men do Nothing; towards end v-o says "With their hoes and machetes, the extremists had killed three times faster than the Nazis. An estimated 800,000 people had been murdered in 100 days"; then Clinton speech 1998	archival	Interahamwe, Hutu extremists, RTLM	M	racism		direct	Tutsi (main), moderate Hutu	F	TRUE	H

Instead the force was cut from 2500 to just 250, after the murder of 10 Belgian soldiers" and no equipment reached Rwanda before genocide; then v-o says 120 000 people awaiting trial (with footage of perps) but only 200 prisoners have been convicted and says at this rate it would take over 300 years to try them all; then they go visit hospital with 56 beds but around 70 patients, so in some cases they are 2 to a bed, with v-o saying life extending medicine costs 400 per person per month but most Rwandans make less than 1 USD per day "it is the mathematics of injustice. If the widows lived in Britain the NHS would provide drugs that would extend their lives 10 to 15 years"; then v-o says that Avega "in a small but brilliant way" is able to help, then drive to a village ouside Kigali with one house for each widow; they go to meet widow Jeanette who was raped by 9 men, now has AIDS, and 5 of her 7 children were killed in genocide, Esther explains that even in an Avega village it is not easy to talk openly about rape and AIDS, prompted by Bradley Jeanette (with Esther interpreting) says that the bonds and community in Avega village is special; then v-o Keane mentions counseling provided for children; then footage of Bradley playing and dancing with children; then v-o says "amid all the horror, hope really is possible", then Eugénie and her brother has been found a home in Avega village, then v-o with another appeal to audience to donate emphasizing "our shared humanity"; then they drive to Nyarubuye at border to Tanzania with Avega, where Keane had visited in 1994 with road to "desolation" (intercutting present-day footage with 1994 footage of Keane leaving car and, in 1994, seeing corpses everywhere), then they are in church building with skulls with Keane pointing out children's skulls and that violence took place over 3 days and mayor said to go to church and was about "getting them into one place so that they could be killed more easily", then footage of piles of clothes; then v-o says when "killers arrived the classrooms were full"; Keane and Esther talking about being like "living dead" and says "it must be something similar for the killers" and Keane says that "people like you make me feel that it's [it = a force for good] there, the fact that you can even talk about forgiveness and reconciliation"; then v-o Keane says survivors and perps "live side by side" and go to church together, with footage of mass; then v-o talks about Valentina (with footage of girl with hacked off fingers and skull injuries [also shown in Ghosts of Rwanda and other docs]) who had "seen her family killed" and spent "several weeks hiding amongst the bodies", then present-day footage of Valentina at same church where she had been hiding and the people were killed; then Esther, Valentina, and Keane talk about Valentina's plans for future and she wants to take Chemistry and Biology and hopes to become a physician, shows a group Rwandans singing and drumming; then v-o says "we started out by saying that this was a love story, what else would you call it, a story were Valentina a child of war will devote her future to healing, a story where widows of genocide gather in the orphans of genocide. I think I learned lessons from this journey, from this story, lessons about hope and most of all generosity"; Keane says he's managed not to banish his memories of genocide, but "to set alongside them" some other memories of "some of the smiles and principally the courage and feeling of hope", then footage of Bradley playing with children shown again with Bradley in v-o saying that he didn't want to come back again, but says that these women live with it and "it's a lesson for the world"; then Esther who says "I see Rwanda a little bit like I see Avega. At the same time you have some hope" and points to seeing all the bodies in 1994 but now it is "more or less normal again", but worries about help coming too late to widows with HIV; v-o appeals to audience to donate and says that while on one hand you're giving "hard cash" on the other you're giving the widows "a home, an education, a decent living, and love", and v-o says that many of the widows won't be alive on the next "red nose day", but "their children will be and you will stand beside them in a country where Hell has been and giving them hope"; end credits with v-o talking about how one can donate	archival	FAR (implied), RTLM, militia, Hutu extremists	M (implied)	racism		direct, archival	Tutsi	F	TRUE	H

The government was responsible for their death."; Mukampore interviewed who survived unconscious then conscious among the dead for several weeks; Keane then says "by the end of April nearly half a million people were reported dead in Rwanda.  The rate of killing was almost five times faster than the Nazi death camps." but world still inactive and UN forces scaled down after ten UN soldiers were killed by extremists; archival footage of Gaillard talking about 2 mio IDPs and more than 500 000 dead, then in interview he says "they cannot tell us or tell me that they didn't know.

But such killers wont spend their lives in gaol if they confess and apologise. The government says this is to promote reconciliation.  Gitera will go home to the same village as Flora Mukampore in six years."; interview with Mukampore who is afraid of their return; then Renzaho says "the worst thing for me was killing my neighbour.  I used to share a drink with him.  His cattle used to graze on my land.  It was like I killed a relative."; Keane about Mukampore and group of children surviving massacre at Nyarubuye and Mukampore losing 17 of her family, and she says "there was no family left to go back to"; Rwamuhizi "there's nothing I can say.  Even when I dream, my body changes in a way I cannot explain. These people were my neighbours. The picture of their deaths may never leave me.

Mères Courage (Mothers Courage, Thriving Survivors)	2005	Léo Kalinda	Rwanda	0		52		Canada, Rwanda			[https://emro.libraries.psu.edu/record/index.php?id=2704: Filmmaker Léo Kalinda narrates and dedicates this timely and cathartic documentary “to the memory of my massacred family.” Interweaving archival footage with courageous stories from survivors of the 1994 Rwanda genocide, Kalinda is able to bring semi-closure to understanding the genocide, loss of his mother, extended family members, neighbors and friends. For 100 days between April and July 1994, the majority Hutus put into action to ethnically cleanse Rwanda of its minority-empowered Tutsis. The plan is to first slaughter Tutsi men and boys, followed by women and girls, and lastly a general massacre of all Tutsis. During this short period, it is estimated that nearly one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus are killed, and thousands of women and young girls raped and infected with the HIV virus to prolong an agonizing death. Paradoxically in a post-genocide society, women survivors welcome the opportunity to become full citizens. Prior to the genocide, women are treated as children with little to no rights. In the aftermath, a significantly reduced male population is forcing Rwanda to redefine its roles for women and enact laws to empower them to become adopted parents, businesswomen, farmers, house and land owners, masons, politicians, seamstresses, and witnesses in a court of law. The primary focus of this documentary is Athanasie Mukarwego, a mother of four and widow of the genocide. She is brutally and repeatedly raped by nearly 500 men in front of her children for three months. Miraculously, Athanasie doesn’t contract the HIV virus. In spite of the daily torment and shame, Athanasie, along with other widows of the genocide, empowers herself to survive by harnessing courage, hope and strength to tell her story to other survivors. She encourages women to form women associations, and create song and dance troupes as a form of therapy to give voice to those unable to express their traumatic experiences. Through therapy, most of the young women speak candidly about being infected with the HIV virus, and the psychological effects of rape. One teenager tells how difficult it is for her to concentrate on her studies because she is raped at age six alongside her mother. Another teenager wails as she remembers trying to give her mother water, but is unable to do so because the mother’s neck is sliced open by a machete. One woman says she will never be the same again after watching her husband’s skull crushed. Still, for the survivors there is some comfort in bringing the guilty to justice through the Gacaca court tribunals. However, critics estimate that it will take at least 100 years to bring all guilty parties to trial. There is also the lingering psychological and sociological damage caused by the genocide which will not be fully known for many years as the civil war left behind thousands of orphans, and women feeling guilt, and shame associated with rape. Yet, in spite of this tragedy, this documentary serves to empower and uplift broken souls. It forces all of us to see how the dehumanization of a people is turning into a positive change for social and economic freedom. Through a determination to survive, hard work, and continual healing these women look forward to building a stronger Rwanda for all Rwandans. Stealing a proverb from the film God Sleeps in Rwanda, “They say my country is so beautiful that although God may wander the world during the day He returns at night to sleep in Rwanda” Dufaux’s photography is breath-taking, and numerous artists contribute to a remarkable soundtrack which overshadows the brutality and beauty that is Africa. This reviewer could not find any fault with the technical aspects of the film as it was professionally made for Canadian television. Mothers Courage, Thriving Survivors can be used to support African and gender studies, as well as studies to analyze the psychological and sociological cause and effects associated with genocide. In addition to this program, I recommend teachers, researchers and librarians consider previewing the following programs: Forsaken Cries: The Story of Rwanda(The Video Project), God Sleeps in Rwanda (Women Make Movies), In the Tall Grass (Choices Video), and In the Wake of War (Bullfrog Films).]						direct		F	TRUE

Flower in the Gun Barrel	2008	Gabriel Cowan	Rwanda	0	en	86	New Artists Alliance	US			following is from https://profilbaru.com/article/Flower_in_the_Gun_Barrel: "Flower in the Gun Barrel is a 2008 documentary film focusing on the process of reconciliation and forgiveness in post-genocide Rwanda. The film depicts both the current conditions in Rwanda and the buildup to the genocide in 1994. It is unique in that it illustrates the complex challenges of average citizens attempting to forgive the neighbors who slaughtered their families. It is a testament to what human beings are capable of. The topic of forgiveness, and the difficulty of coming to terms with those who have killed one's parents, siblings, children and neighbors, is a universal theme that comes to life through the example of Rwanda. Synopsis: To a large extent, the film consists of interviews with genocide survivors, many of whom were children in 1994. In all, over thirty survivors, perpetrators, and experts were interviewed for the film. In these interviews, the survivors discuss what it means to be a Rwandan and to live next door to people who killed their families. The survivors describe how they deal with their country's request that they forgive one another and move on, so that Rwanda can rebuild and unify itself. Perpetrators' views illuminate the madness that seized the culture in 1994; exploring the experience of apologizing to victims, and examining what it is like to be looked at as a murderer in Rwandan society. According to Flower in the Gun Barrel, there were a series of events that led to the genocide. The colonization of Rwanda, first by the Germans and then by the Belgians, led to conditions wherein the citizens of Rwanda were intentionally pitted against one another. As a means of dividing and conquering, the Belgian occupiers took what had been primarily economic distinctions between Rwandans and turned them into ethnic distinctions instead. Previously, a Tutsi was defined as a Tutsi if he owned more than ten cows. A Hutu owned less than ten cows and usually worked in the fields. Creating an ethnic class and empowering the Tutsi as "upper class" created hatred and jealousy between these newly imposed "tribes". In 1959, the Belgians left Rwanda and Hutus quickly took over the government. There was a series of battles between the Hutu and the Tutsi between 1959 and 1994, during which Tutsis would often take sanctuary in churches in order to survive. Knowing this, the Hutu government in 1994 forged partnerships with several Catholic priests, prefects, and nuns, such that this time no Tutsi could be saved. There were innumerable massacres in churches and convents; sometimes officiated by the priests and nuns themselves. In a country of seven million people, one million were killed in one hundred days. The Hutu government succeeded in killing 75% of the Tutsi population. After 100 days, the RPF stopped the fighting and a year later, over 100,000 perpetrators were in prison. This put an impossible strain on both the economy and the judicial system. The new Rwandan government, led by both Tutsis and Hutus, responded by creating the Gacaca (translated as participative justice) court system. Previously, the Gacaca courts were used to settle domestic disputes and small crimes. Suddenly, the courts were asked to resolve issues of genocide and murder; overwhelming tasks for untrained judges. Prisoners were told that if they admitted their crimes and apologized to their victims, they would be set free. This created a certain amount of doubt amongst the victims, as to the level of contrition the perpetrators actually felt. Nevertheless, the Rwandan government has appealed to both sides to forgive, so that their children can grow up in a united country. They have rewritten the Constitution of Rwanda so that the country is required to have a plurality of power between Hutus and Tutsis. There is a new national anthem calling for unity. The reality for most Rwandans is that reconciliation is a daily struggle. Hutus live ashamed of what they did, and Tutsis live with the bitter memory of what happened while they try to forgive. It is this struggle that "Flower in the Gun Barrel" depicts. Crew: Flower in the Gun Barrel is the first documentary feature by director Gabriel Cowan. The Rwandan community has invited the film to have a preview showing at their annual gathering in July, 2008. It is produced by Amiee Clark and Monica Forouzesh and edited by Woo Tony Joun. The film is narrated by Martin Sheen."

Ndahayo  then  directed  his  first  feature  documentary  film,  Behind this Convent (2008), about the massacre at the convent in the town of Astrida (Butare) on April 10, 1994, where Interahamwe killed 153 Tutsis and dumped their bodies in a pit behind the building. Among the victims were Ndahayo’s parents, and he himself narrowly managed to escape. Using his own as well as eyewitness survivor testimonies, this documentary is quite conventional and is rather in line with a survivor documentary such as Keepers of Memory, were it not for the lack of emblematic images (there are images of the excavation of corpses), the lack of historical  contextualization— although it is framed by the 1998 Clinton speech and a closing text that blames the  UN— and the fact that the film does not end as other reconciliation films."]						direct						Zanzibar International Film Festival

It is not a straightforward film about Hutu perpetrators confessing their crimes. Instead, the film observes how the prisoners make plans for their re- entry into society. One prisoner wants to buy some land, while others dream of a new cell phone. When released  the  next  day,  there  are  tearful  reunions:  wives  hugging  husbands, fathers greeting children, with rising music on the soundtrack and close-ups filmed in slow motion. In short, the Hutu perpetrators are shown as human beings. However, the twist is that the filmmaker then juxtaposes them with one prisoner, seemingly the only one who feels remorse about his crimes, thus pointing to the possible problems of releasing these prisoners. With this setup, the film turns into a critique of Rwanda’s chosen path to reconciliation, thus straying from the official narrative."]

then shot of central prison in Kigali with prisoners outside; Bagosora at ICTR testifies and says he accepts (in French) that Tutsi were at some point killed for being Tutsi (calls it madness, "folie"), and when asked gives the date of April 12 as the starting point of this racial killing, claims number of 500 000 dead was wrongly calculated and given by American intelligence on April 7 already [???], says that after the war another 500 000 were added and believes 1 mio is exaggerated; then footage of unnamed perp taking notes watching trial alternates with that of Bagosora; Bagosora continues and says that 1978 census only gave 10% Tutsi out of population of 7.138 mio. and therefore if only 700 000 Tutsi existed in the country and only half of those, by his guess died, only 350 000 victims are Tutsi and thus if one counts victims as a million the majority of victims are Hutu; perp asks who the person is on TV and is then told Bagosora [he clearly knows the name but not the face]; then Faustin Twagiramungu at ICTR, says in Engl that ethnic distinction was "defined by foreigners", prosecution cross-examines him and asks whether there was a law making racial distinctions and forcing them to carry racial ID cards, response is evasive Twagiramungu was "target" because he was "in opposition"; then perp watched Twagiramungu footage says they used ethnicity because they were "affamé du pouvoir", he was school inspector not because he was more intelligent than the Tutsi, but because they had searched for a Hutu who could best fill this post, says he knows both sides since he's married to a Tutsi; then Marie de Dieu, identified as wife of Jean de Dieu, the perp present in doc so far, asked what she felt upon her husband's arrest, and says that she had thought him incapable of such crimes, and that she thought those who killed should die, but that he had explained to her that it was a group crime and then she was angry he had been slandered; then RTLM audio track talking about Machiavelli's Prince saying it's better to be feared than loved [this is never made explicit, but the broadcast is by Ruggiu who is at ICTR in next scene] over footage of Rwandan football match; then Jean-Louis Gilissen, lawyer of Georges Ruggiu (accused), talks of of Ruggiu as "homme banale", a Belgian who befriended Hutu from the North of Rwanda, same as Habyarimana, and subsequently went to work for RTLM, believing RPF were taking power by force and were not democratic; de Dieu talks about how "travailler" meant "tuer", and says that RTLMs insults of Tutsi as insects etc. motivated them and that's why he [presumably Ruggiu] is at fault; another RTLM broadcast from April 1994 inciting to kill; then again Twagiramungu interviewed, talks about plane crash; then Laurien Ntezimana (later captioned as Theologian) watching proceedings of Ruggiu, followed by Ruggiu at ICTR who talks about making list of peoples dead and peoples in danger and said they had the list to avoid confusion about who was dead or not; then audio of RTLM about how Agathe Uwilingiyimana's "départ est nécessaire"; Ntezimana talks about hearing about plane shot down and thought maybe things could change now, but his politician friend said that they were done for; then prosecution at ICTR saying no one could be charged for shooting down plane, because of lack of evidence, then Bagosora's lawyer says that the plane was crucial, he points to des Forges saying so, causal event sparking genocide; then Bagosora talks killings on April 7 in Kigali and Gisenyi which were targeted [implied: at specific people, not race] and not "systématique"; Marie de Dieu talks about sending her husband to meetings to find out what was being planned, since her family members were RPF and would be targeted; when asked J. de Dieu says he fortunately wasn't asked to kill his wife, only towards the end when few Tutsi were left there was pressure, but the RPF came; more RTLM broadcast from June 1994 over footage of Rwandan street; then Bagosora claims he never ordered anyone to kill, then his lawyer relates that Bagosora had said earlier he did not believe it was genocide, just "massacres excessifs", Bagosora says massacres were not "planifier en avance" because they were not "systématique" immediately after the plane was shot down and that targeted ("ciblée") killings were done, had there only been the plane crash, however, he believes the anger ("cholère") would have passed and killings would not have intensified, only in response to the RPF which displaced 1 million people "alarmé toute la population" and says that the massacres were carried out in a "désordre totale" "sans responsibilité politique" and that they were "victimes" of a "mauvais politique internationale"; Twagiramungu interviewed about genocide plans and he says he believes he was privy to "different soueces" and says that "nobody, nobody talked about end plan [sic]" moderates/democrats, when pressed by prosecutor about Interahamwe training, he answers in French and says this genocide cannot be compared to the genocide of the Jews  because the former "il ne me semble pas longuement prémédité" and says that "if there has been preparation of massacres, believe me, they were not directed only to Tutsis" [sic], judge then calls for break; then Ntezimana also says, in response to footage of Twagiramungu, he hadn't heard of a plan and says that his understanding of the genocide was that it was "progressive" and that if there were planners, there were few, the others participated because of "intimidation" "peur" and "avidité", then tells story of his "fils dans la famille" [a sort of cousin in fact] who was the burgomaster of Runyinya with the name Déo Hategekimana who initially fought against killers coming from Gikongoro in the south and chased them off, but they came back with soldiers from Butare who told him "tu t'arrange ou tu meurt" and so he shot the Tutsi he initially had defended and thus Déo was not a planner, but nontheless an authority in participating in genocide; then Bagosora's lawyer says there seem to be two extreme claims, with those claiming all killings were spontaneous on the one side and those of the prosecutors on the other who claim everything was planned before April 6, and that instead killings happened through fear ("peur"), the RPF invasion and defeat of FAR, and the government instability in Kigali; back to Ntezimana who tries to answer how so many could be recruited so quickly for killing, and he says it was because the "gens" "écoute[nt] à le pouvoir" and refers to "Irivuz'umwami" explained as king's orders which must be obeyed or you are executed, a tradition that during colonisation had been replaced by "Ndiyo bwana" which means "Oui monsieur" which to him is the same; then RTLM broadcast in Kinyarwanda with song [features in many docs] about "cockroaches" having been "exterminated" from June 1994, broadcast ends in laughter; back to ICTR with Twagiramungu who can't describe what he saw upon leaving Rwanda in April 1994; then commemoration ceremony with Kagame at Murambi and says in Kinyarwanda that "Murambi is marked by the sin of genocide and the failure of foreigners" and goes on to say that "foreigners not only have a share of the responsibility in the events that led to the genocide, they too committed genocide like the Rwandans" and asks "what right do the French have to try the Rwandans?" and vaguely mentions pressure for RPF to be tried; back at Kigali prison with food preparations; then ICTR then Carla del Ponte talking about Barayagwiza ruling and says she was surprised because she had been told the "procureur était indépendante" but the appeals chamber in this ruling forbade her from trying this case and that the Rwandan govt. "a réagi très dure" to the ruling and that she had not received a visa to go to Rwanda, was unable to enter her office in Kigali, and has not been able to talk to the authorities and says that they are dependent on the Rwandan govt. to continue "nos enquêtes" [this part of footage also shown in Rwanda, une justice prise en otage]; then gacaca trial with Marie de Dieu interviewed about what made her decide to be a gacaca judge and says she was elected by locals, says she initially didn't want to; then gacaca proceedings of an appeals session with unnamed perp saying he was found guilty with testimony of only one person, one of gacaca judges says they only accept those who repent, another judge says that "those in prison are all guilty", but perp protests that there are some who are "innocent", but judge insists that if there are dead then there are those who did it, perp steps back and sits down, then all prisoners driven back to prison; Ntezimana talks about gacaca which he says deals mainly with accusations, just like ICTR and talks about perps only talking if they don't have to pay with their life or freedom; back to Jean de Dieu watching Ruggiu who pleads guilty, then Ruggiu at ICTR who is asked about pressure exerted on him and he says he was pressured not to reveal what had happened in Rwanda and he confirms that it was a genocide and "malheureusement j'y ait participé" and that he came to this tribunal for moral reasons and that pleading "coupable" is "morale" and the best he can do, then he pleads guilty to all charges (to incite genocide and crimes against humanity); then Ruggiu's lawyer talks about the ideologues, the crazy people etc, but says that it is rather the normal people that count and that jury doesn't judge "monstres" but "hommes qui ont commis l'horreur" and adds that we are all "capable" of the worst; then judge delivers sentence for Ruggiu who gets two concurrent terms of 12 years for each incitement to genocide and crimes against humanity; then Kigali prison again; then M. de Dieu talks about other children being uneasy around hers because J. de Dieu was involved and is awaiting verdict; then J. de Dieu who is asked about "frontière" between guilt and responsibility, and he says "je me sens coupable" but says his responsibility is collective and only those who "frapper" or who used "un fusil" are directly responsible, but says there's no easy distinction, says he feels he has been "pardonné en moitie"; then back to Bagosora's lawyer who reads a statement by del Ponte who said that the tribunal will never be able to tell "toute l'histoire de la tragédie rwandaise" and esp. not its "genèse", and says his client has been discredited for not accepting ICTR for being a victor's court, and the question of whether or not Bagosora ordered to kill also cannot be proven, but lawyer insists that this tribunal may not be the court of victors, but it certainly is the court of the defeated, since only the defeated have been tried; ends with audio of judge saying judgement will be delivered in due course over footage of empty trial chamber; then over footage of Rwandan houses intertitles say Bagosora was found guilty in 2008 of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he has appealed; J. de Dieu, after completing a 9-year sentence, was sentenced to a further 30 years at gacaca; end	direct	RTLM, Interahamwe (main)	M	obedience, group pressure, fear, greed, intimidation, political opposition		none	Tutsi (main), moderate Hutu	none	FALSE	T

Rwanda: Beyond the Deadly Pit	2009	Gilbert Ndahayo	Rwanda	0	en, Kinyarwanda	106		Rwanda		available on US amazon prime	Gustafsson, 2024, pp. 222-3: " That same year Ndahayo moved to the USA, where he made his second film, Rwanda: Beyond the Deadly Pit (2009), also a multiple award-winning documentary film, including a nomination from the African Movie Academy  Awards. This  feature  documentary  moves  on  from  the  survivors to the perpetrators of the convent massacre. Reusing material from Behind the Convent, Ndahayo continues to explore the genocide by confronting his parents’ killers during a Gacaca trial. At the same time the film widens its context by including archive material such as the 1998 Clinton  speech— but no emblematic images— as well as interviews with expatriates and survivors who now expand their testimonials with accusations aimed at the Rwandan Catholic Church as well as the Western powers, foremost the involvement of the French. Accordingly,  the  personal  approach  to  the  memory  of  the  genocide  is expanded  in  Rwanda:  Beyond  the  Deadly  Pit,  something  which  certainly  has international influences but also elements of Rwandan nationalism as we have seen in the films of Kabera, including tackling the theme of reconciliation. In Rwanda: Beyond the Deadly Pit, the killer of Ndahayo’s parents ask for forgiveness and Ndahayo reluctantly gives it to him, thus fulfilling that particular theme of Rwandan nationalism, as well as international expectations according to the international reconciliation film. However, by intercutting survivors questioning the perpetrators at the Gacaca court with filmed images of himself expressing doubt, Ndahayo maintains the personal perspective, and thereby complicates the conflict between personal trauma and the benefit of reconciliation and national unity."]	direct					direct						Nominated for African Movie Academy Awards

[sic] That is when the first colonialist arrived and changed it as he wanted [over stills shown of various white men and then white men meeting Rwandans]. Rwanda was strong and respected in the region because of its strong leadership hierarchy [shows Rwandan warriors with bows] from the king to the servant. This was enhanced by the unity of Rwandans of that time. This made colonialists wonder more about this country, especially about the methodology [sic] of ruling the colony, of 'divide and rule', which was not possible. Since that time they created ways of creating differences between Rwandans [shots of white men measuring skulls of Rwandans] and it has been successful. This is what brought the terrible crisis based on ethnic divisions that plunged Rwanda in the genocide against the Tutsi in 1994. Some of the old people who were there say it in these words" then stills of people with captions introing them, Dr. priest André Kibanguka, genocide survivor, headmaster of college Saint Andre (Kigali, Rwanda, 1986, 1992, 1993, 1994-2012), Antoine Mugesera, historian and author and former Rwandan senator, Dr. Tito Rutaremara, RPF Inkotanyi commissioner, Rwandan senator and former ombudsman, Dr. Nason Munyuandamutsa, PhD in Psychology, professor at National University of Rwanda, vice-president of the "Institut de recherche et de dialogue pour la paix" (IRDP), Dr. Dominique Rwakunda, expelled from National University of Rwanda in 1973;

then intertitle 1959 with Mugesera standing by a tree is asked about Tutsi killed in 1959 and he says that Tutsi made up most of the Belgian-led govt. with Hutus making up possibly only 12%, people were working on independence, incl. king Rudahigwa but after his death political parties started, with some being mentioned by Rwakunda who is now interviewed sitting outside, and says he was a member of the party UNAR and claims that "all the educated people" and all those "who do not believe in discrimination" were in it; Mugesera says "Belgians didn't want to lose both Congo and Rwanda and "decided to fight against the UNAR party" and "put PARMEHUTU led by Gregoire Kayibanda into power" which was "a bad party because it favored ethnic discrimination" and had only Hutus in it whereas UNAR had both Hutu and Tutsi, continues that PARMEHUTU considered Tutsi the enemy and "they burnt Tutsis' houses without considering their positions or parties" and says that Belgians "supported this action accepting that the enemy is a Tutsi";

Mugesera talks about coup d'état in January 1961 by the "congress Gitarama" and talks about independence being "given" by UNAR even though it ended up being the defeated party in the elections in 1961 and in the end PARMEHUTU profited from successful independence and emphasises UN role in approving independence; intertitle 1963 with Mugesera talking about "INYENZI troops attacked from Burundi" and that INYENZI were made up of Rwandan refugees who were not helped by UN [footage of manuscript by Mugesera from March, 2004, Kigali, Les Éditions Rwandaises], followed by numerous jagged edits;

Mugesera talks about "genocide" being used in 1963 and 1964 by "people like Russel and a teacher at the national university called Viremen" with Virement apparently coming from France and working for UNESCO, talks about killings of "children, adults and old people" in Gikongoro and says that the Vatican station broadcasted the notion that there was genocide; then intertitle 1973 with Mugesera saying conflicts in 1973 were "within the government itself" with the decision to unite the PARMEHUTU party and replace Tutsi with Hutu; then Rwakunda says he was expelled, then Prof Deo Byanafashe also talks about Tutsi being chased from schools by the group "Comitée du salut public" which made lists of teachers and students to be expelled, beaten and some even to be killed; then v-o over archival still of someone hitting someone else lying on the ground with a tool saying "experts in social relations agree that in these years for the big majority of Tutsis were not only killed but also suffered torture, community discrimination and in schools and at the work place" [sic] then interview with Dr Nahason Munyandatsa talking about isolating and casting people out implying that it was an "easier" way than simply killing Tutsi; Rwakunda says he continued his education with Burundi govt. help in Kinshasa; Mugesera says that Tutsi were persecuted in every single school in the country; intertitle "1982" with Mugesera about "conflicts in Uganda" but says "I don't know the cause" and says that Uganda president Obote thought that the Tutsi refugees were supporting his enemies and he chased them back into Rwanda where they stayed in Mutara and Kibungo and they were discriminated against and not allowed into the country to join their families;

I think that they just looked at one side. Minister Karugarama said that even if only 10% were victimized. Will that be the general case to discredit the gacaca process? But among the 10% they never report the Tutsi assassinated during the gacaca courts period [atrocity photos shown]" and Mukorasibo replies that international organizations "never consider" that the gacaca are for "both sides" and says that many people wrote theses "discrediting achievements by the government led by the RPF"; v-o talks about policies and education of unity and reconciliation; then Bamporiki talks about how "I am a Rwandan.

Rwanda Gambit	2013	Andre Vltchek	Rwanda	0	en	134	Asia-Africa Kappa Productions	Kenya			[promotional material: "Rwanda Gambit is a groundbreaking 134-minute high-definition feature-length documentary film written and directed by Andre Vltchek, one of the world’s most prolific documentary filmmakers and authors. Drawing on what the filmmaker says is his “duty to bring philosophy, history and facts together,” this important film challenges the official Western narrative on Rwanda and the genocide that occurred there. Is Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame really a savior of the nation, or one of the perpetrators, who was at least partially responsible for the 1994 bloodbath? Kagame’s armed forces – RPF – were, before 1994, supported by the United States and by its close ally – Uganda. Was RPF responsible for the 1994 downing of the plane carrying the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi? All the passengers on-board died; the event that triggered the genocide. Why did the international community derail the investigation? What came after the genocide? Rwanda and Uganda invaded DR Congo, overthrew governments and engaged in the plundering of natural resources, on behalf of Western companies and governments. The plunder still carries on, as well as mass slaughter that could be easily defined as the worst genocide since WWII. Between 6 and 10 million Congolese people have died in the past two decades. Filming of Rwanda Gambit took place over a period of more than three years in the territories of Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, DR Congo, Kenya, South Africa, as well as in the United States, Europe and Japan. The film contains exclusive, dramatic footage and dozens of key interviews with genocide victims and perpetrators as well as members of international tribunals, diplomats, UN employees, Kagame’s close circle of friends, investigative journalists and other key figures in this complex and ongoing tragedy. Rwanda Gambit premiered at film festivals internationally to audience praise and extremely positive reviews. A three-hour version of the film, until now never before available, is being offered to academic institutions in the United States. Rwanda Gambit is an important addition to any college/university curriculum that includes the study of Rwanda — and to any individual who wants to learn about one of the most horrific ongoing events in recent African and world history."]												
The Rwandan Night	2013	Gilbert Ndahayo	Rwanda	0	en, Kinyarwanda	107		Rwanda		available on US amazon prime	Gustafsson, 2024, pp. 223-4: "The  third  documentary  feature,  The  Rwandan  Night  (2013),  grew  out  of the first two films, reusing interview material from both, but now a historical and a chronological perspective is introduced whereby colonialism serves as an explanation for the genocide. According to Ndahayo, The Rwandan Night is more research- based than the previous two films, which were more emotionally driven. Still, The Rwandan Night is largely driven by the emotional aspects of four interrelated and intercut subjects: survivor testimonies, this time given by  survivors  in  the  diaspora,  like  Ndahayo  himself;  the  2006  commemoration ceremony at Nyamirambo stadium; expert interviews made at the third international conference on genocide at Sacramento State University in 2011; and, finally, “the longest monologue in the recorded history of survivors in Rwanda.” It is this continuous poetic monologue, performed by the oldest survivor of the genocide, Fidele Sakindi, in combination with the use of original Rwandan music for the commemoration ceremony, which helps to define this film as an “ethno- documentary.” 82  Paradoxically, it is Sakindi’s poetic narration that contributes to the historicization of the  genocide— starting with the haunting memories of the 1959 Rwandan Revolution where thousands of Tutsis were killed and some 336,000 fled the country 83 —thus combining poetic and factual elements in a similar way as with Michel Bouquet’s poetic narration of Holocaust survivor Jean Cayrol’s script in Night and Fog (1956). In  the  press  material  for  The  Rwandan  Night,  Ndahayo  clarifies  the  reasons  for  the  inclusion  of  this  monologue.  It  is  not  there  just  to  give  room to a Rwandan perspective. According to Ndahayo the voiceover in Western documentaries  about  the  genocide  is  “useful  when  the  filmmaker  does  not have enough footage nor understand [the] subject. Voiceovers oversimplify the narratives and create distance between the audience and the characters even when the shots are close- ups.” 84  Hence, Western documentaries about the genocide against the Tutsi are singled out as uninformed and  oversimplified—  thus justifying  the  Rwandan  drive  to  correct  this  historical  memory.  As  a  director  Ndahayo  retains  his  unique  personal   perspective— in  The  Rwandan  Night through Sakindi’s  monologue— but as he becomes more critical of the international historical media memory of the genocide, his films increasingly meet.more and more criteria for survivor nationalism. Hence, the diaspora seems to create a critical distance to filmmaking and the historical memory at the same time as the diaspora seems to generate increased proximity in relation to the nationalist perspective."]						direct

Rwanda: The Untold Story	2014	John Conroy	Rwanda	1	en	60	BBC	UK	FILE	https://vimeo.com/107867605	[see Straus 2019, p. 4 for critical assessment of doc; documentary overall quite one-sided narrative - no other experts on death count and genocide dynamics are consulted, even though this is surely the most controversial claim that can only be abused by deniers; similarly researchers who would definitely not agree with each other on e.g. the death counts -- Reyntjens vs Davenport and Sam -- are interwoven into a seemingly coherent story accusing RPF of mass violence; part of "This World" series produced by BBC; created massive controversy after airing, Kinyarwanda BBC was banned in Rwanda, and BBC commissioned inquiry into BBC conduct, see Hazel Cameron's somewhat problematic account: https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/113649/News/bbc-had-an-agenda-to-twist-rwanda-history---uk-expert; Reyntjens gives overview over responses to and commissioned inquiries into doc (he himself is interviewed in doc): Reyntjens - Briefing. The Struggle over Truth - Rwanda and the BBC, African Affairs, 2015; and Reyntjens repudiates other problems here: https://africanarguments.org/2014/10/rwandas-untold-story-a-reply-to-38-scholars-scientists-researchers-journalists-and-historians-by-filip-reyntjens/] opens with v-o commentator saying that "Rwanda" being still "ruled by its dark history" and the "senseless barbarity of the genocide" (with archival images of roadblocks), but then states "we think we know the story, but do we?", then mentions Rwanda ruled by Kagame who's regarded as saviour by many in the country, but asks what kind of person he is; quick succession of sound bites of interviewees saying Kagame is a dictator, serial killer etc.; then images of Kagame with "powerful friends" = Tony Blair; then Kagame at Amahoro stadium during commemoration day with Blair and Ban Ki-moon (then still head of UN) present; intermittent close-ups of Corbin (=producer) looking at the crowds (suggesting she is narrative centre; first-person singular v-o commentary is also female); then mentions Rwanda's economic recovery, "spotless" streets, free healthcare; gives death toll as 1 million; then shows excerpts from film (Hotel Rwanda); them Corbin/narrator (using "I" = first-person singular) says that former members of Kagame's inner circle question govt's account and that she had to go to South Africa to get the story, where she meets former general Kayumba Nyamwasa [who is likely involved in killings of civilians as former RPA and also as possible subsequent rebel group leader, acc. to UN, but this is not mentioned] who states that Kagame's intent was always to win the war, not stop genocide [this is in line with findings from Des Forges report]; then interview with Theogene Rudasingwa who talks about Rwanda as "repressive" state; then v-o commentator says to find out "truth" about Rwanda we need to know more about the ethnic conflicts, which leads brief recap of Rwandan history starting with colonisers favoring Tutsi while Hutu majority were "denied their basic rights", then Hutu revolution & independence with several hundred thousand fleeing to neighboring countries esp. Uganda; then interview with historian Filip Reyntjens who talks about refugees as "time bomb"; then founding of RPF and Kagame's rise with Kagame ruling RPF by early 90s and invading Rwanda's north leading to 1 million Hutu refugees; then Hutu witness testifying about fleeing north after RPF attack and reporting that word was RPF was "killing lots of people"; then v-o commentator saying that "some of the events that led to the genocide are not disputed"; then more info on Rwanda in 90s with Habyarimana having ruled but then facing international pressure to share power with RPF with his signing Arusha 1993 opposed by extremists (archival footage and photos of Kagame and Habyarimana at table in Arusha); Reyntjens suggests that Tutsi RPF thought that they couldn't "take power by the ballots" [this also supported in McDoom] and that by end of 1993 RPF had "decided to take power by bullets"; v-o commentary mentions political murders on both sides; then interview with Luc Marchal commander of Belgian UN forces who says situation was tense; then v-o commentator talks about assassination of Burundi's Hutu president by Tutsi and massacres of Hutu civilians [but doesn't mention contemporaneous killing of Tutsi civilians] and Hutu fleeing to Rwanda with horror stories about Tutsi; then arrival of RPF troops ["the 600"] but mentions "many more troops were smuggled in" and suggests that Kagame "is now alleged he was preparing for war", with corresponding interview of Rudasingwa who says RPF had infiltrated country with close to 2000 men; then armed Hutu militia on other side training and stockpiling weapons and radio broadcasts and newspapers whipping up hatred against Tutsi; then plane with president shot down (with footage of random plane and then two random black people in plane, then footage of wreckage); "within hours units of Hutu soldiers were on the rampage" and Hutu militias setting up roadblocks (then footage by Nick Hughes of killing); v-o commentary says that plane crash is widely accepted as the spark for genocide and that the story became quickly it was shot down by Hutu extremists, but that over years evidence "has come to light that questions that assumption [that plane was shot down by Hutu extremists]" with corroborating interview of former Kagame bodyguard Aloys Ruyenzi [the only interviewee of Kagame's former circle who does not speak Engl., he is synchronised from Kinyarwanda] who "claims" he was in meeting with Kagame a week before plane crash with Kagame approving plan to shoot down plane and then also "claims" RPF had smuggled anti-aircraft missiles and describes happy reaction by Kagame and commanders when heard that plane was shot down and that "from that moment we [RPA] started to move"; then interview with Luc Marchal who says for him it is "clear" that the plane crash was "trigger" for invasion [his original French hard to hear over synchronisation]; UN investigation led by Jim Lyons (interviewed) into plane crash finds 3 RPF claiming knowledge of assassination preparations, Rudasingwa also claims that these preparations were "open secret"; then mentions French court ruling RPF shot down plane and indicting RPF officers; then v-o commentator says "Paul Kagame declined to be interviewed for this programme" but that he has always denied shooting down the plane; Nyamwasa says he is "100%" sure that Kagame was behind shooting down of plane and claims that he would come forward at French court even if it implicated him, because "the truth is what matters"; then doc tries to strengthen ties between assassination and genocide, with Rudasingwa saying that there wouldn't have been genocide if Habyarimana had lived and that Kagame "bear responsibility" and that they "were a factor" and Nyamwasa saying that while he believes Hutu extremists were planning genocide without doubt Kagame "contributed" with his plans; then back to present-day with ethnic labels banned, but v-o commentary mentions that narrative of genocide is mostly of Hutus killing Tutsis; then interview with Christian Davenport and Allan Stam (then both at Uni of Michigan) who claim that everyone had exactly the same govt-sanctioned story and that "the story was made up" & their data showed that Tutsi killings had largely ended before Kagame's troops arrived (with footage of both looking at map highlighting deaths and advancing RPF lines); Marie, Hutu survivor, claims she and her family hid Tutsi neighbors and were fleeing, but says RPF was bigger perpetrator than Interahamwe; then v-o narrator states Nyamwasa was "indicted for war crimes" and admits to RPF killings of civilians ("it's not a rumor, it's a fact") but also clearly states these were "not planned"; UN report shown [Gersony?] saying that RPF committed mass killings in the tens of thousands, Rudasingwa saying the report was "suppressed" by UK and US govt.; Luc Marchal says that international feels guilty (and that it should feel so) over inaction, but also states that this is no excuse to cover up Kagame's responsibility for mass killings; then Corbin with director of Murambi memorial in Murambi looking at mummified corpses where 50 000 dead are claimed; then v-o commentary notes that questioning official story of genocide is now a crime and that "it is widely accepted that around a million Rwandans died in the genocide in just 3 months and the government says over 90% were Tutsis", but now Sam interviewed who claims that violence was source of every side and just part of civil war and that "hundreds of thousands of people died for no particular purpose"; Sam continued to be interviewed (interspersed footage of Rwandans across country) saying "if a million people died in Rwanda in 1994, and that's certainly possible, there's no way that the majority of them could be Tutsi" with Corbin asking "how do you know that" and Sam replying "because there weren't enough Tutsi in the country", with v-o commentary saying that "the Americans calculated there had been 500 000 Tutsi before the conflict in Rwanda, 300 000 survived" and that therefore it must be the case that only 200 000 Tutsi died and that 800 000 dead were the Hutu, whereas Rwandan govt. asserts there were more Tutsis to begin with and that nearly all of the dead are Tutsis; Sam says that they don't deny genocide happened in Rwanda but saying that genocide was the only thing that happened "that would be like saying in WWII the only thing that happened of interest was the Holocaust", then mention of Sam and Davenport being banned from Rwanda; then Rwanda after genocide a "shattered" country with Tutsi being "in reality" the leaders and that "the killing didn't stop"; then RPF Kibeho killings with brief footage from the attack which was also witnessed by UN peacekeepers, with Brit UN officer interviewed who states a civilian woman wanted to surrender but was shot down by RPF; then v-o says Kagame would only admit to 338 refugees had been killed, whereas official UN death count was over 2000, while UN medics counted nearly 5000 dead; then Reyntjens saying that given the evidence no one can deny that RPF has committed "on a massive scale" "crimes against humanity and war crimes", then Reyntjens being called one of the world's experts on Rwanda and also being banned from country; then goes to prison in Kigali to interview local official that "was involved in the killing of at least 2000 Tutsis" and who says [speaks in Kinyarwanda, Engl. synchronisation] his motivation was "power is sweet. It feels good. So as a leader I had to protect my area against the people invading the country.

French, Engl. synchronisation] and she says Kagame told her "you're finished being prosecutor at the Rwanda Tribunal" when she pressed for trying RPF war criminals, and that she then had turned to Kofi Annan who had told her it's "all political" and that therefore "the US didn't back me up, the UK followed suit, as always [she smiles], and my mandate was not renewed"; then Jim Lyons interviewed about his team's investigation into airplane attack and that Louise Arbour (his supervisor) told him to shut down investigation, Louise Arbour did not respond to doc-maker's request to be interviewed; then conclusion of ICTR who found 63 people guilty with v-o commentator saying "they are all Hutus"; Reyntjens interviewed saying that ICTR has become "unfortunately a pathetic instance of victor's justice"; Rudasingwa talks about Kagame's impunity extending even to Congo; then v-o gives brief overview of Congo crisis with refugees, including FAR and "militas responsible for the genocide"; Nyamwasa who was in charge of campaign says that the "principal objectives" were justifiable because of ex-FAR border incursions; then Marie refugee talks about Rwandan forces raping her and killing refugees systematically over footage of suffering; then v-o commentator saying "Paul Kagame's invasion of the Congo began a decade of conflict" with other African countries drawn into; gives Hutu civilian death count as hundreds of thousands [this is roughly scholarly consensus]; Nyamwasa again saying that there was no justification for going to Congo, but he was sidelined and Kagame started the war, and that "what happened thereafter is something that was very unjustifiable [difficult to hear exactly]"; refugee Marie was airlifted out; then footage and journalists recording atrocities, and UN surveying 600 massacre sites with the report saying that if confirmed these crimes could be characterised as genocide; then Kagame recording saying that there was no genocide in Congo; v-o says that "a million had died in Rwanda, an estimated 5 million died in the decade of war begun by Kagame's invasion of Congo"; Kagame arrives to meet foreign dignitaries with v-o commentator saying that "his actions in the Congo, the evidence of war crimes in Rwanda don't seem an obstacle to their close relations", then notes that nearly half of Rwanda's govt. spending comes from foreign aid with Britain the largest donor and Blair being unpaid advisor to Kagame; Blair, too, "declined to be interviewed for this programme" commentator says, then several snippets of Blair defending Kagame; then Reyntjens interviewed saying Clinton and Blair should revisit their relationship with Kagame, "because actually their closeness is a closeness with what I call the most important war criminal in office today"; then allegations of election fixing in 2003 with Nyamwasa saying he was involved in fixing elections, with Reyntjens saying also saying elections were "fake"; Nyamwasa saying that UK and US are wrong when thinking Rwanda needs "strong leader" and instead it needs "strong institutions"; then story of Victoire Ingabire main opposition leader in Rwanda being imprisoned for 8 years apparently because she had asked why there weren't memorials for Hutus who died; then interview (in Engl.) with Patrick Karegeya who was former security chief who states that "all the basic freedoms don't exist"; then recorded phone call between "allegedly" a top Rwandan intelligence officer and contract killer, then interview with Robert Higiro who made recordings, which supposedly ask for Nyamwasa and Karegeya to be killed for being "suspected of plotting a coup against Kagame", Higiro says he tipped off the targets and fled to Europe instead of organising the killing, yet Karegeya was successfully assassinated, with Nyamwasa having survived 4 attempts on his life and 4 assassins have been found guilty in South Africa, then v-o commentary says that a dozen have been killed "or just disappeared in the past 15 years"; then video of Kagame issuing threats against those who "betray Rwanda"; then interviews with Nyamwasa and Rudasingwa who emphasise that reconciliation only possible if crimes committed by Kagame are tried and told about; Rudasingwa and Reyntjens predicting instability in Rwanda; v-o commentary says again that Kagame was given "opportunity to respond to the allegations raised in this programme but declined"	direct, archival	RPF, FAR, Hutu militias (incl.

People were afraid of losing power, safety, property, and most of all they were afraid of being killed in the civil war that had been raging for years before and during the genocide" and "Local elites seized control on almost every hill. They warned Hutu villagers the approaching Tutsi rebel army would kill them if they did not follow the new law of the day, exterminating the "enemy" Tutsis. Afraid of becoming victims, people transformed into perpetrators" also mentions killing of Hutu moderates but somewhat muddled "Hutu extremists killed Hutu pacifists. Neighbor killed neighbor. Rwandan killed Rwandan"; later Tim Longman in v-o points out more explicitely that Tutsi were killed because of race and Hutu moderates because of political opposition; then Hughes archival footage of killing and footage of roadblocks and photos of victims; perp Jean is interviewed; v-o says "reconciliation isn't a choice" but "is actually the Rwandan governments official policy"; Anges a survivor who was raped and whose family was killed tells of a workshop where she without prior knowledge was forced to meet perpetrators' wives; Alexander tells how he helped destroy Agnes' house for fear of being killed himself -- although later he suggests rather government pressure and peer pressure -- and how he was one of the first to confess and whose children are now looked after by Agnes; Jean says he killed because the government told him to, but crosscut to Grégoire, who organised massacres and still serves a life sentence, says that to blame the government is too easy because "the government is not in our hearts"; occasional archival footage of Interahamwe training or corpses on streets with little context or indication of provenance; Grégoire admits that without his order to kill "nothing would have happened" and admits some responsibility; intertitle with quotes from survivor Frida Gashumba "these people can only talk about forgiveness, because they have no idea of what we have been through"; Grace tells how she is still traumatized and ostracised by her family; Pacifique a victim of Theosphore who helped kill her family and served 10 years in prison introed; v-o changes to American male [transcripts says it's Tim Longman] and gives historical overview of pre-genocide Rwanda and colonial history states that "Some people will say today that the colonial governments invented ethnicity. That's a little too simplistic, but what we can say is that the colonial governments gave much more importance to these identities, made them more rigid, racialized them, and made them much more problematic", mentions price of coffee going down, also mentions RPF invasion as a contributing cause for genocide "In 1990 when that process [of scapegoating the Tutsi by Hutu-led government] started, there was an invasion of Rwanda by the Rwandan Patriotic Front. That was an army that was made up mostly of Tutsi refugees. When you had a Tutsi army that was attacking Rwanda, suddenly it became possible for the government to say “Look, the Tutsi want to take over again and they want to oppress you,” because a lot of people lived in fear", then talks about plane shot down as trigger, mentions RPF war crimes "The RPF itself carried out war crimes and human rights abuses, and they've had no accountability for that whatsoever" and also talks about the complete failure of the international community; journalist Sam Nshimiuimana says even if reconciliation is not fully real at least people aren't taking revenge on each other, he describes reconciliation and unity as a repeated national prayer, later says that he'd prefer the word tolerance to reconciliation; an RPF official talks about occasional "peace spoilers"; Domitilie, who survived with her husband but whose husband was killed later in function as gacaca judge, says victims are still in danger and that there is no peace; female "African" v-o returns to explain gacaca; perp Jean says that "of course there are no problems" because if there were problems that would mean there is "no unity"; an RPF govt. official is asked if she thinks everyone can reconcile and she admits it's a difficult question and that some choose to reconcile and others to coexist; director of African studies at Boston university Tim Longman says that "it becomes very clear that most people don’t really believe that narrative [of reconciliation and increased democracy]" and mentions later some of his students who hid Tutsi, but one of them betraying them and telling death squads of hidden Tutsi and the legs of  one of the hidden Tutsi, named Obed, was chopped off, and says American students should be glad they're not in same situation of Rwandan Hutu students that betrayed fellow Tutsi students; ends with epilogue saying Grace has reconciled with her relatives and went to law school, Pacifique forgave Theosphore, Jean confessed to murder and served 10 years, "Extremists continued to murder judges and witnesses until Gacaca courts closed in 2012. Paul is one of more than 180 survivors murdered since the genocide ended", then states "President Kagame was reelected to a second term with 93% of the vote. Presidents are limited to two terms." [2-term limit has been changed, also there's no mention of strong international criticism of fraudulent election] and then says "Reconciliation efforts remain a major part of the president’s agenda.

Intore	2014	Eric Kabera	Rwanda	0		76		Rwanda			[gustafsson, 2024, p. 213: "Nevertheless, in Kabera’s latest directing effort to date, Intore (2014), efforts are made to achieve a more complete and inclusive nationalism based on the memory of the genocide. As with Through My Eyes, the focus is on Rwandan youth and Rwandan culture as a unifying factor, beyond divided ethnicities. Kabera interviews several cultural workers and artists repeatedly throughout the  film—  musicians, singers, songwriters, dancers, composers, poets, language teachers, and historians; among them singer/songwriter Corneille Nyungura, who at once states that his father was Tutsi, and his mother was Hutu, thereby highlighting the issue of dual ethnicities existing in one person and thus in one country. These interviews are not merely survivor testimonies as in previous films. Instead, the different artists draw on their experiences to analyze the genocide and its causes on a personal level, using this then, in a second step, to analyze how Rwanda can move forward. During these interviews Kabera inserts black- and- white flashes of emblematic images such as “Corpses by the Road, “The Nick Hughes Footage,” and The Man with a Machete” in order to visualize the difference between the past and the future, which in turn is richly illustrated with sequences about Rwandan traditional dance, classroom teaching, and the music festival Kigali  Up— cultural events that feature participants from both ethnicities, although this is never mentioned as it would go against Intore’s idea of one national identity. Even brief flashbacks from Gacaca trials are reproduced in black and white to show that Rwanda has now moved on. This outlook is hopeful, but it is also dependent on an analysis of the past and the genocide as something foreign, or as one artist explains, “the whole genocide  was  not  Rwandan  at  all,  and  it  was  because  Rwanda  had  lost  its own culture.” That is to say, European colonialism destroyed a deeply rooted Rwandan culture which must now be revived through the use of the arts as a way to move forward, both drawing on ancient traditions of dance as well as modern expressions such as rap music. Or as another young artist expresses it, “1994 does not define what we are as people.” However, what complicates the issue with Intore and its aim for national unity is its connection to the old military institution of Itorero and the precolonial  kingdom’s  Tutsi  elite  warriors,  Intore  (translated  to  “the  chosen ones”).  In  2007  the  Rwandan  government  introduced  Itorero  ry’Igihugu,  a nation- building and development program that was implemented country- wide in 2012 with the intention to rehabilitate the nation by using a new interpretation of this old, Tutsi, military tradition, whose war dances are the same as the traditional dances that occurs in Intore."]

back to Nyirahategekimana who couldn't give the money to Siboniyo, then talks about Ex-FAR soldier Emmanuel who took her in, but Emmanuel's father said that she should not be killed in the village where everyone knew her and should be taken away, so they tried to go to Kigali, but because of frontlines had to turn back to Gitarama around May 17, then talks about a bus of predominantly naked Tutsi men and boys;

Dr Nyiramilimo talks further about surgical procedures and medical interventions, is shaken and tells documentary maker to conclude the session; Dr Sezibera talks about trauma of raped women and that the genocide cannot be forgotten, talks about sexual torture with inserting pointed branches and the use of rape and sexual torture as a means of genocide to prevent "a future generation of Tutsis"; Birarara again briefly, saying that nobody had thought of Tutsis ruling again, then Nyandwi talking about govt. orders to kill, Birarara again who says he never would have thought he would be persecuted by locals or internationals and was very confident he would be "rich" after collecting his victim's properties, Nyandwi says he has been given a life sentence but was released early but "I feel I am forgiven because if I am to be honest with you, I don't even merit life sentence but death"; Birarara says he was never accused at gacaca for having killed but only for rape, says he has spent more time in prison than outside and got 25 years and says he is "blame worthy" of the genocide; Nyandwi says "my life is over" and says "going back into Rwandan society is more complicated than being in prison";

Inkotanyi	2017	Christophe Cotteret	Rwanda	0	en, fr	126	Wrong Men North, Veilleur de Nuit, RTBF, Arte	France, Belgium		https://guidedoc.tv/documentary/inkotanyi-documentary-film/	[includes interviews with Paul Kagame, Museveni, various other high-ranking RPF among them James Kabarebe, former Rwandan defense minister, who led RPF into Congo, FDLR general Paul Rwarakabije who is also interviewed by Jason Stearns in Dancing in the Glory of Monsters; dedicates about as much time to congo wars as to the France-Rwanda diplomatic spat over French Habyarimana assassination investigation]; story of genocide is told also including international inaction (some focus on Albright's book) and foreign nationals being flown out, mentions RPF atrocities within Rwanda but claims this was due to lack of discipline and that Kagame had hundreds of his own men imprisoned and some executed as a deterrent and v-o claims that Kagame was now using "reign of terror" to force unruly soldiers and population into submission and it "remains to this day" but v-o says about this reign of terror "one question remains to this day: whether he had a choice"; then interview with Kagame who vaguely talks about "that some things are going to happen and some things happened"; then Kibeho massacre described as Interahamwe infiltrating refugees and attacking RPF with RPF response leading to 4000 killed but v-o claims "many of them trampled to death in the resulting mass panic" with photos of dead, Rony Brauman from MSF talks about massacre but doesn't mention trampling; Kagame and other Rwandan officials in interview accuse Europe of inaction when perps were fleeing to DRC; Museveni about Kabila and Kagame, v-o says both form an alliance; interview with Kabarebe interviewed about meeting Kabila;

General Paul Rwarakabije [former leader of FDLR] interviewed (in French) who says "Inkotanyi" left a humanitarian corridor to Rwanda for refugees willing to come back; v-o claims [falsely] that "almost 90%" of refugees returned to Rwanda; Brauman says that no country tolerates being attacked and that reaction to invade was understandable but Brauman talks about massacres of refugees, described in terms of "revenge", with Red Cross, MSF, and UNHCR digging mass graves and tending to refugees [scale of killings not mentioned]; v-o describes the overall situation as "new humanitarian disaster" and then moves on to talk about RPF and Kabila reaching Kinshasa and ending Mobutu's rule; then falling out between Tutsis/RPF in DRC and Kabila being described by v-o as due to "material" temptations of DRC and Kabila accusing "the Inkotanyi" of enriching themselves; then Rwarakabije about leading FDLR in Rwanda; then footage of Kagame speaking or giving orders to someone off-screen to his right; v-o about Rwarakabije withdrawing his forces into Congo and now allied with Kabila and v-o suggesting [misleadingly] this was the outbreak of second Congo war and says that war was mostly over Congo's "mineral reserves" with international community looking on; then v-o talks about difficulties of aftermath after genocide as story turns to reconciliation in Rwanda with Kagame saying there's no purpose in "killing those who killed" and about the end of the death penalty in Rwanda; then Tito Rutaremara, Rwandan senator and co-founder of RPF-Inkotanyi, who says every Rwandan was affected by genocide as every Tutsi knew victims and every Hutu knew perpetrators even if they didn't participate themselves; then v-o about Rutaremara being key in the gacaca and says that "almost 2 million cases were tried" and half of them resulted in "convictions" and judges "were taken from the population", says that the point was to prevent revenge, and those who were judged to be "henchmen rather than commanders were handed jail sentences of around 7 years"; Kagame talks about everyone involved being given justice according to their level of accountability; then footage from gacaca with a woman talking about how someone could have survived if only the accused [presumably, they are unseen] had only saved "him" [presumably the victim]; Kagame talks about his sympathy with victims who feel injustice at killers remaining alive with families intact; v-o talks about difficulties of integrating perps with victims, then Rwarakabije capitulating; Rwarakabije interviewed talks about meeting Kabarebe and Kabarebe telling him that when they fight each other "it means that Rwandans die on both sides"; then v-o said that most perpetrators "however" [but Rwarakabije was uninvolved in genocide, see Stearns] would be held accountable and talks about Bagosora and Kambanda;

then French official pursuing case against Kagame for assassination of Habyarimana with French journalist Patrick de Saint-Exupéry talking about the case being for "state interest" with Saint-Exupéry who says it's entirely spurious and seemingly written by a 9th grader; Faustin Kagame says (in French) talks about France supporting genocidaires during the genocide and says that [with rather flawed logic] that such cases [about the assassination of Habyarimana] "make the victims responsible for their extermination" and calls it "extraordinaire"; v-o about the problems of the difficult diplomatic relations between Rwanda and France because of this which were only resumed after the report was criticized by French inquest over TV footage at the time of Sarkozy and Kagame shaking hands; then Alain Juppé, French foreign minister in 1993 to 1995, who talks about the falsification of history and suggesting that it's insulting to France [presumably the change of opinion on the report]; then Faustin Kagame who says "we'll get there" and they are not "resentful" and says "we Rwandans also bear responsibility of course. We are primarily responsible for everything, all of us"; then intertitle Kubaka Igihu (Resilience); then footage of Nyarabuye memorial site and graves being built and bones laid out on canvas in grass; then v-o talks about paradox to "define contemporary Rwanda" with footage of Kagame celebrating and v-o talking about Kagame being re-elected three times "with significant majority" but his policies "fell considerably short of Western standards" and questions were raised about his polls, but points out that "he's enjoyed genuine popularity as a garanteur of stability and security now so desperately needed" and then talks about amending constitution that had imposed term limits on president; then audio of journalist of Rwandan New Times [largely in sync with official state opinions] asking about Kagame's message to Rwandans who in overwhelming majority voted to remove the term limits and what his answer is to "critics abroad", then Kagame says if he's called dictator then "dictatorship" is being "given a good name" mentions that he's granted stability, security, empowering women, food security; then v-o talks about Kagame's vision of "pan-Africanism" and about communal work [Umuganda] with footage of Kagame participating; interview with Kagame who says that Africans continue to get a "bad deal" in politics and economy and "Africa is always at the bottom" and says that "pan-Africanism for me carries a lot of meaning in that sense that we are a unique and unified entity" over footage of ordinary Rwandans trading, at market, on bicycle etc.; then v-o says "we are not the Inkotanyi soldiers who risked their lives as 20-year olds in 1990, we are not the Rwandan leader, garanteur of a national unity that was utterly shattered here in Rwanda, all Western filmmakers can do is uncover and observe the particular circumstances that define Rwanda, the contradictions, and the common ground. Resilience does not mean resolution and healing, but it is a process on the path to healing and in today's Rwanda it can only be hoped that its people will be able to find that strength to banish the demons of the past once and for all"; credits over aerial still of Kigali

The 600	2019	Laurent Basset	Rwanda	1	en	114	private	Rwanda, US	FILE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-EIMGMNqnU (interview with writer/producer)	producer/writer says 95 off-camera and 55 on-camera interviews, 80 hours total of footage, doc uses mix of archival footage (mostly photos), reenactment, CGI animation, testimony (against black background with varying camera angles on testifiers), closely follows the RPA/RPF version of events, those interviewed are exclusively RPA or Tutsi survivors who mostly speak in Kinyarwanda, some in English, and none in French, audio use is very conventional with dramatically orchestral base humming and, in hopeful moments, violins or piano droplets; "The Diaspora" opens with a quick intro of genocide and 600 RPA soldiers trapped behind enemy lines when genocide began; then talks about the independence and Hutu power movements committing atrocities -- 20 000 Tutsi dead in 1962 and 25 000 to 35 000 Tutsi dead in 1963 -- formation of RPA from the diaspora of refugees from these; some training footage and soldiers interviewed; a key point is a Kagame speech excerpt; their goals as army is repeatedly described as bringing equality to Rwanda; "The Message of Hope" emphasis on the importance of song to the soldiers; survivors speak about listening to RPA radio station as giving them hope; survivors say that listening to radio could get you killed [even before genocide it seems]; some reenactment of people listening to radio; then the selection of 600 accompanying RPA politicians sent to Kigali to renegotiate the Arusha Peace Accord with news footage; "The President's Plane Crash" survivors give impression of premeditated planning of killings before crash; commentator says plane was shot down by Hutu extremists; killing starts, then the 600 are surrounded by various govt. forces; Kagame orders 600 to stop genocide (narrated over distant trumpet sounds); Vestine Muzirankoni (St. André school and nearby church massacre, April 8 1994, survivor) retells the story of her survival (she's filmed from different camera angles while testifying) and a reenactment of a man with blood dripping machete is superimposed behind her; then story of a mass for newborn Tutsi baby during genocide (with reenactment) recounted by the aunt of the baby when church is attacked by Interahamwe, congregates flee to St André but the baby's father is killed on April 11 (with footage showing school in present day); then Prosper, also at St André, tells story of his survival under a pile of corpses, with a reenactment of a pile of bloody corpses and actor playing Prosper underneath blood flowing over him and Interahamwe kicking bodies, finally he is helped by Joseph Mukasa a member of a former Tutsi neighborhood watch group; then shows Nick Hughes archival footage of a killing and survival story of then 14-year old Yvonne Umugwaneza who managed to pass by militia roadblocks (with archival footage, but also reenactment of machete with cutting sound) to hide among relatives, but they are visited by neighbor who threatens to kill them (reenacted), yet they're temporarily saved by artillery fire, then soldiers come to their house and they think they will die; dramatic intermission describing RPA operations at Amahoro stadium alternating with story of Antoine who is warned and hides in his house, but then attacked by militia (with French guns he says), but then saved by RPA counterattack which also liberates stadium; another RPA attack on Camp Kigali is repelled by Rwandan govt. guard; meanwhile at parliament RPA major David Rwabinumi defends Parliament, and RPF politicians within, (=CND =HQ of the 600) rooftop with heavy gun (now commemorated with statue which is shown); survivors and injured Tutsis flee to Parliament building and get medically treated by RPA medics; Rwabinumi continues story of defending building, then archival footage of shelling of building, but he holds presidential guard at bay; then 2000 reinforcements (alpha company) walking for 3 days non-stop to reinforce eagle company at CND; then joint attack on and conquest of mount Rebero from behind where govt. army had artillery, but a platoon is needed to be left behind to help injured genocide victims encountered on the way to Rebero; from there soldiers start rescue missions, soldier tells of saving raped girls in Nyanza; soldiers talk about trauma of seeing victims (with archival footage of corpses), one of them had family in Nyanza and found his mother killed, a moment seemingly commemorated in a memorial statue in Nyanza which is shown [somewhat impatiently his long pauses, silences, water breaks are edited out]; then story of RPA Théogène trying to save his uncle who is held hostage at a roadblock in Nyamirambo disguised in uniforms as FAR soldier, uncle tells of his relatives who turn out to be Yvonne and her relatives; reenactment of Théogène knocking at their window; they go to Rebero, but hit a roadblock with milia and Interahamwe (reenacted), but manage to fool them and get their grenades upon request, yet eventually other roadblocks smell the ruse and shoot at them, but all 53 survivors and the company of 7 manage to flee all the way to Rebero: Yvonne tells of her happiness upon arrival; then back to St Andre where Interahamwe approach the building again (reenacted), but "God saved us" by sending a "sacrificial cow" which distracts Interahamwe who pledge to return next day, but during the night RPA sent by Mukasa soldiers come to the rescue; chapt "Rescue at Amahoro", begins with story of Antoine who fled there April 17 because UNAMIR soldiers were there, we see him visit the present-day building and explain where they took shelter, then shelling on April 19 and we see static shots of present-day parts of stadium with a hand then holding a photograph of same part of stadium in 1994 displaying corpses and wounded, Antoine challenges UNAMIR soldiers to fire guns at attackers but they say "we've been told not to fight", with commentator following up that most UNAMIR soldiers are being pulled out of the country altogether, Antoine continues saying that the militia killed people in front of UNAMIR soldiers, then evacuation by RPA to sugarplantation; chapt. "Saint Paul" & Saint Famille with around 2000 refugees, three survivors tell their story, among them Beatrice Uwera, who revisits church in present-day, and Gilbert Masengo, who says he'd been fighting Interahamwe already before the genocide, we see CGI animation of the location, Beatrice continues her story at church, then reenactment is superimposed with ppl taking shelter, priest Celestine tries to keep them safe but on June 14 Interahamwe arrives and starts killing the men, someone from the churches makes it to RPA and they start a rescue mission (Bravo & 600) with a diversionary attack nearby to pin the govt. forces (with photos and reenactments of soldiers marching at night), RPA commander testifies that when RPA arrive people in St Famille people in church didn't want to open doors and were apparently armed with guns [thus suggesting the story of passive defenseless victims at St. Famille as rendered by survivors seems to be not entirely true] and thus they moved on to liberate those at St Paul and leave those at St Famille behind, survivors testify RPA arrival at St paul was like "It's God", then reenactment of escape from church with present-day Beatrice nicely faded-in and superimposed walking down the same staircase; "Liberation Day" opens with testimony of survivor Paul Rukesha (who now works at KGM) who was hiding in a house with his family, then on July 4 RPA had captured all the hills of Kigali and "government forces & civilians" flee the city (as shown on digital map with inscriptions) and Paul says he was looking at RPA like "supermen", then various RPA soldiers (incl. a woman) testify about their mixed feeling of victory and loss on liberation day; chapt. "A Soldier's Story" opens with Philbert's story that is cast as being representative, he describes finding most of his family dead save for two nieces and grieves over the fact that he couldn't save his family, Philbert says "It's a tragedy that came to the Rwandese, but I'm glad I contributed!, with God of course"; "Epilogue" voice-over commentator says "25 years later, the acts of bravery and heroism displayed by the 600 and RPA still live with the survivors of the genocide" followed by laudatory testimonies, some of them with religious overtones, one married an "Inkotanyi", then plaque is displayed saying "In Memory of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda", then final song composed by Maji Maji who sings it for audience over photos of RPA soldiers; then credits over footage of soldiers singing by fire [remarkably no effort is made to explain what happened to those left at St Famille]	archival, reenactment, animation	Interahamwe, unnamed other militia, Presidential Guard, Hutu extremists	M (implied)	racism	French government	archival, reenactment, direct	Tutsi		TRUE	H

Theater of Violence	2023	Emil Langballe, Lukasz Konopa	Uganda/Sudan (LRA)	0	Danish, en	104		Denmark, Germany			[burning bush and burning thatched hut metaphorical images shown at regular intervals throughout film] opens with dress fitting of Dominic Ongwen, then intertitles with quote from Ezekiel 9:6, then intertitle telling about ethnic conflict in Uganda between Acholi and LRA vs Lango (with President Museveni) with Museveni's govt. interning 2 mio Acholi (all this over slow-mo footage of bush fire), overall conflict attributed to British colonial past with redrawn borders of Uganda; then trial, Ongwen denies guilt, then Uganda 6 months earlier with lawyer Krispus Ayena [who is the protagonist of the film] meeting American journalist, talk about Ongwen abducted at age 9, asks about when he transitioned from victim to perpetrator; then Ayena visits Ongwen home of who have become effectively his replacement parents [we later hear his parents were likely killed by LRA]; Joe Kanayero childhood friend testimony talks about abduction (himself included) and that disobeying orders meant being killed; audio of Ongwen talking about being forced to kill escapee when he was young; then prosecution team with Fatou Bensouda ICC, Ben Oumpet, Colin Black talk strategy; followed by defense team follow strategy of duress from "spiritualism"; Kankanyero in court describes killing of escapee with axes he and Ongwen and everyone else had to watch and says Ongwen's parents likely killed by LRA; then discussion of retributive vs restorative justice with the latter being described as African and the former as re-colonisation; we find out in court that Ongwen raped all of his forced wives, ordered murders of camps; then ICC proceedings shown on tv at grass top gathering in Pajule, North Uganda, with emissaries explaining to skeptical locals that Ongwen is prosecuted because he is the highest-ranking perpetrator apprehended, when locals ask why the govt. is not prosecuted, and emissaries reply that the govt. can be taken to court in Uganda; history of Uganda, ethnic and political conflict is largely recapped intra-diegetically through British news reports; Ayena's car stuck in ditch while it's dug out Ayena talks to North Ugandan locals who seak out against govt., LRA officer who is also among locals briefly interviewed; back to ICC where Ayena makes point about "Theatre of Violence" suggesting that all agents of violence in north Uganda should be considered; then Tommy Obote (local leader), American journalist & seeing ICC as serving Western interests; then tv report on ongoing election violence in Uganda; Ayena visiting house of Kony's wife, who tells her daughter about being abducted at age 12, mother does not tell children about their father too openly, when daughter expresses faith that her father was trying to do good and, when mother expresses skepticism, asks mother whether he had helped mother, but mother replies he hadn't and awkward silence follows; Ayena describes Kony as "amiable" and "very, very nice" whose dark side is difficult to infer from his personality; interview with another LRA officer Achama Jackson who refers to Ezekiel and says LRA are soldiers of god; later he is interviewed in court where he is asked why LRA killed innocents when LRA rules forbid it, and Jackson replies that when spirits dictate everyone in battlefield be killed even innocents are killed; then Bobi Wine's (main opposition candidate of Museveni) arrest shown live on film; then Julius Ochen talks about govt. camps; followed by Cambridge Prof. Adam Branch stating at court hearing that camps and Uganda's policy of forced displacement of mainly Acholi killed far more people than direct violence; Ongwen states that "God will remember me" & that he wouldn't be treated this way if he weren't African; prosecution concludes that perpetrator-victim phenomenon fairly "mundane" in "domestic" cases with sex offenders often having a history of being abused but are nonetheless pronounced guilty; defense statement repeats duress and edited to end on statement that Ongwen was "a victim"; then Achambo talks about spiritualism; then election news report with elections in favour of Museveni with 58% of votes; dramatic re/enactment of child disappearance in field as if taken by LRA, scene ends inconclusively with boy remaining gone; then ICC verdict: guilty on 61 charges, including sexual torture, rape, killing, judge says that Ongwen in "normal course of events" would have been a "valuable member of the community" but instead violent conditions of LRA led him towards violence, Ongwen gets 25 years in prison, rather than life sentence because of these circumstances; ends with extreme slow-mo on Christian procession through bush, singing; final credit title says that court upheld sentence upon appeal; post-talk with Ayena and filmmakers: Ayena says he is "paragon of peace" having pacified rebellion in Northern Uganda before and Kony who had heard of Ayeana and wanted peace talks called him up to help negotiate and Ayena met Ongwen through his interaction with Kony and LRA at this occasion; filmteam originally interested in peace process in Uganda and got interested in case of Ongwen after hearing about him and his apprehension; then talk about ICC and colonialism with Ayena saying he doesn't think it's mainly "targeting" Africans, but doesn't think ICC addresses "parameters in Africa" like "spiritualism" and believes that Kony's spiritualism is duress as if gun were held against perpetrators' heads (which would be accepted as duress in the West), because they believe Kony omniscient; filmteam shot film on tourist visas and if asked about film equipment they replied it was used for shooting nature; Ayena noticed govt. pressure and lost his seat in parliament, but believes improvement in Uganda because of peace talks, then claims he is victim of LRA as well with 6 family members abducted by Kony, but nonetheless says he is "very sympathetic" to the cause; filmcrew mostly talked to Ongwen after case (not allowed during trial proceedings) and spent much time with his family; Ayena later gave up as Ongwen's lawyer and someone else is his lawyer now	direct	LRA, Ugandan army	M	ethnic repression, spiritualism	Northern Ugandans	direct	LRA abductees, female sex slaves, Acholi (by Ugandan army)	F, M	TRUE	T

The Genocide Factor	2000	Robert J. Emery	various	1		228			DVD/FILE		4-part series on genocide from biblical times until today; part 2 "Genocide in the First Half of the 20th Century": opens with disclaimer that series examines events not considered genocide by Lemkin or the UN convention in order to arrive at a "complete" picture; then bible quote, Deuteronomy 4:9, "take heed...lest you forget" etc; then Jon Voight enters a room (prominently with yellow david star and the word "ghetto" on a wall behind him) and talks about the genocide convention; then Peter Rosenblum (Harvard Law) talks about the limiting factors of convention (social groups and cultural destruction are excluded); then back to Voight who says "here now the history of genocide ... " and opening credits; then Yehuda Bauer who again talks about genocide convention (then images of random skulls); then survivor Apollinaire Ndayizeye gives testimony of atrocity in Burundi that killed 70 members of his family (in background church choir humming sounds); back to Bauer who says that 169 mio civilians were killed by gvts in 20th century and goes on to say that 4x as many civilians were killed as soldiers in the same timespan; then B. Ferencz; then commentator talking about Roosevelt initiative to end wars (in response to Armenian genocide); then commentator talking about American slavery and attacks on natives (unlike the other cases of atrocity this one does not get an intertitle) and talks about African Americans as continuing to live as 2nd class citizen, then talks about white lynchmob in Greenwood (largest single incident of racial violence in US); then Tulsa survivor Eldoris Mae McCondichie interviewed and some archival photos are shown (again background church choir humming); then Rosewood massacre with survivors again being interviewed and commentator talks about how it took Florida 77 years to acknowledge the incident and arrange compensation; then commentator talks about how these cases are not strictly speaking genocide but "reflect many of the circumstances that are typically present" in genocide, and then goes on if genocide def. also considered systematic disenfranchisement, segregation, and discrimination then African-Americans had a strong case; next case is "Ukrainian famine 1933" (and that of its neighboring provinces), talks about the relevance of the "kulak" to Ukrainian famine (as if this was a native category) and Stalin's wish to "communize" agriculture; Robert Conquest is then interviewed who says that nearly as many were killed in famine as in WWI; then commentator talks about increased quotas (impossible to meet) and too much rain in 1931, by August 1932 supplies depleted, then Stalin order to kill anyone who resisted (over archival footage of undetermined origin, we are led to believe that this is from grain procurements, but this is not possible); gives 14.9 million people died in this famine, though says that this is only an estimate; calls Ukrainian peasants an "ethnic and social class" and continues on to Great Terror for which Ukrainian terror was the origin; interview with famine survivor; then "The Japanese/Chinese Experience 1937" opens with testimony of japanese soldier who talks about killing a pregnant Chinese woman (then images of piles of corpses); then commentator talking about how warfare is sometimes accopanied by systematic violence against civilians to terrorise and undermine the country's "social and cultural viability"; mentions the book The Rape of Nanking (with footage of Japanese shootings of Chinese) and then interview with its author Iris Chang; then interview with another Japanese soldier (Ueha Fuichiro) who says he was ordered to "rape and to burn"; first soldier's interview continues who says "It would be alright if we only raped them. I shouldn't say alright, but we always stabbed and killed them. Because dead bodies don't talk": then commentator with images of killings of young men in Nanking, and commentator gives numbers of "estimated 20000 to 80000" women were raped and vivid description of Japanese toture and an image of decapitation just after head is cut off; 260 000 noncombatants were killed acc. to official investigation but commentator says that some experts believe number closer to 350 000, then mentions Japanese denial "until very recently"; another interview with Japanese (Nagatomi Hakudo, an old intelligence agent) who says he "I want to make up for what I've done.'" and that "I have reflected upon my guilt" and says "I feel strongly that we should never have fought this war of aggression."; Chang says that Nanking is not the only one with this fate (like Auschwitz it's a symbol); "The Holocaust 1937-1945" starts, somewhat strangely, with Spanish civil war and commentator effectively states that if fascism had been stopped in the civil war the holocaust and WWII could have been avoided or minimized; then a news report from the time continuing with the same hypothesis and finally an interview with two americans who had fought in the war who also concludes that Hitler possibly would not have begun WWII if he'd lost civil war; then extremely brief bio of hitler, dotted with all sorts of quotes by hitler and goebbels; and then how holocaust combines all typical genocide criteria; Edelmann historian interviewed who seems to promote an extreme version of intentionalism, seeing broad strands of Germans wanting to segregate Jews into camps and then Hitler's Mein Kampf tapped into that and provided "the blueprint" that merely had to be "followed out" by Hitler's followers once in power; Marrus interviewed who talks about the general Nazi programme of deportations and social transformation; then Rosenberg interviewed who says key points of hitler were "militarism, nationalism, and totalitarianism" (but says he is hesitant to "reduce" a complex confluence of factors to such a formula, but then elaborates on each point); then Woolf interviewed who stresses the role of propaganda in carrying out holocaust (her interview is underlaid by mix of propaganda images); Schloss, survivor, is interviewed who says that if only all countries had opened their borders to jews early on most would have survived; commentator sets in and says "to the extent that any given genocide is carefully and systematically planned and carried out with virtually no concern for world opinion" (over images of holocaust corpses) sentence bizarrely grammatically incomplete; then random comment by John Loftus (who was war crimes prosecutor) who says that now archives reveal that Churchill knew about holocaust as early as 1942 (church humming non-stop); then talks about how holocaust "occupies a unique place" in the history of genocides; then some survivor testimonies little connected to the previous (this time screeching violin music); over 6 mio Jews or 3/4 of jewish population was killed plus 10 millions of others were killed incl. gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and "political troublemakers"; then talks about ghetto creation and then attack on USSR with death squad shootings (Stephen Katz is interviewed about this) and mentions local collaborators; then late 1941 beginning of death camps (typical archival footage of camps and liberation shown and corpses shown with no clear narrative continuity or connection to each other); Hitler's deathcount of noncombatants is given as 16 mio; explanatory origin of such destruction is then seen in the indoctrination of the young who were the most fervent supporters of hitler; calls holocaust a "watershed event" like fall of rome, nuclear bomb, etc.; then nuremberg tribunal and extensive speech by nuremberg prosecutor?? shown; then talks about how nuremberg set precedent for later and that superior orders is no defense for atrocity; then Eichmann trial; commentator then stresses the ordinariness and banality of perps in holocaust and that this is common in genocides; then Bauer talks about how all victims of genocide suffer the same and that was makes the holocaust unique is that "every single individual of the targeted group" was "destined" to be killed for "having been born"; then commentator talks about 55th anniversary event of liberation of auschwitz and how some who were present at event that despite state leaders urging to remember holocaust lessons seem not to have been learned given that genocides occurred after; then Johannes Rau president of germany speaking in knesset (first german representative to do so); William Schulz (American) at amnesty international talks about how there's general awareness of holocaust and that knowledge often "doesn't move beyond that", but how most atrocities and other genocides in the world are ignored and ppl are unaware; part 3 "Genocide Since the Holocaust" opens with the usual disclaimer and Deuteronomy 4:9 quote, again intro with Voight with the same intro about genocide and the word's meaning & its going back to Lemkin; then interview with Stephen Katz about use of the word genocide in last 25 years and says that in many cases when word is used by newspapers and that instead it's mass murder b/c genocide requires intention, but emphasises that mass murder is "no less terrible" and "no less criminal", and then says that politicians found it convenient to mass kill and that the world is indifferent or slow to react; followed by intro sequence and the usual church humming audio; then images of 9/11 and its being described as day with most human lives lost in american history, further images of 9/11 over which text appears (while commentator still talks about sth else) saying that taliban requires all hindus (in 2001) to wear yellow patch "reminiscent of the Nazi yellow star during the Holocaust", then commentator saying that just b/c taliban evoke religion doesn't make islam condones such actions and that instead they are driven by a quest for "power, absolute power" as "the underlying force"; then Henry Steiner interviewed who laments that genocide is increasingly seen as merely being seen as a "statistical event" and that genocide is usually seen in terms of scale, esp. when it comes to "other parts of the world that we don't immediately identify with" and says that individual tragedy of being victim of serial killer or victim of a genocide is the same [though this is a bit simple; many jews testify being terrified by their awareness of their extermination as a nation; there's also issue of survivor's guilt after genocide as well as the massive societal transformations after genocide]), and while he continues speaking more quotes are shown (this one from Gandhi); then "The Chinese Experience" under Mao and then Great Leap Forward (reason for it being too slow changes during first 5 year plan and that GLF should eliminate starvation forever) and its disastrous outcome being described as the same as that of famine under Stalin even though Stalin's policy differed; then commentator says that China's govt. always denied famine was result of GLF; commentator then cites McFarquhar's study of one province where normally death rate would be 250 000 but during famine it was over 2 000 000 -- all this is shown over a stream of images of mangled chinese corpses; then gives estimate of "recent Western demographic analyses" about 30 mio excess deaths (another quote; this one Mao's about political power as barrel of a gun); then "The Cambodian Experience" begins with decolonization and Sihanouk's crowning etc. but then vietnam war "was influencing conditions" (no mention of US bombing raids!) and French-educated communists comes to power; then atrocity images of corpses over interview with a faceless australian (Ben Kiernan?? -- he is later interviewed and face shown) describing it as a mix of policide and ethnocide (a.o. of Muslims and Vietnamese); commentator mentions forced labor and 100 extermination centres for intellectuals, teachers, govt. employees etc and then for Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Cham, while simultaneously Cambodians were dying in the kiling fields a.o. from starvation; survivor Sophal Leng Stagg talks about child labour and soldiering; commentator gives death toll of over 1 mio to "perhaps as many as 3 million" ppl out of a population of 10 million; then Tuol Sleng prison with vivid Vann Nath paintings and close ups of skulls and a few of the S21 photos; Steiner emphasises that he considers it genocide; interview with Gregory Stanton from Genocide Watch who is close to tears about baby skeleton with mickey mouse tshirt (violins screeching in background); survivor Stagg emphasises the need that perps should be "held accountable"; commentator sums up that Mao and Pol Pot were responsible for over 40 mio deaths and "once again" exemplify that other humans have to pay "the ultimate price" for "power hungry despots" (followed by anohter intertitle with quote; by Shaw on how Hegel war right that the only thing we learn from history is that man never learns from history); then "Indonesia/East Timor" (but Indonesian 1965-66 killings noticeably absent) and reason for genocide given as Indonesian govt. trying to prevent East Timorese from voting for independence over some atrocity footage and newsreels, incl. a press report by UN worker on site of recovering remains from Passabe massacre; Jamsheed Marker interviewed who was UN special representative in East Timor and gives "reliable estimate" of death count at 200 000 in a population of 800 000 over footage of random East Timorese?? making victory sign with hands; survivor Constancio Pinto interviewed who describes rapes and torture in prison over photos of torture; commentator gives a death ratio of 1/3 of population and says that it must stand as genocide "in terms of the 1948 convention"; commentator says that "finally" UN intervened backed by US, UK "and others" and pressured Indonesia to stop massacres over footage of UN rescuing East Timorese, and commentator goes on to stress importance of international community in preventing more suffering; Pinto interviewed again and asks why violence has not been stopped since Nazis, then random quote in intertitle by Gandhi about God giving freedom; "The Pakistan/Bangladesh Conflict" opens with british withdrawal and splitting up of muslim-majority Pakistan-Bangladesh and hindu-majority India, but problems with political and economic instability, then resignation of Ayub Khan and naming of commander of army as leader who then declared martial law, then declaration of independence by east pakistan and failure of negotiations, followed by army incursion (paramilitary/militia not mentioned) into East Pakistan targeting Bengalis, next "intent to kill every Hindu they could find" by army, mentions public and gang rape of girls; then india intervenes and pakistani army surrenders, then Bangladesh admitted into "Commonwealth of Nations"; gives official Bangladesh death toll at 3 000 000 (w/o indication that this is an estimate on the problems with these numbers, see Gerlach) as well as 250 000 having been raped, 10 000 000 fled to India, and 30 000 000 internally displaced; commentator says that these numbers should be more important than an airline accident that nonetheless tends to grab more headlines; then "The Kurdish Experience" Kurds being described as maybe "the most numerous" nomadic tribe w/o their own country; Asad Gozeh survivor of Hussein's poisonings in Iraq interviewed who talks about collapse of Ottoman Empire and division of Kurdistan; then commentator describes attack of Turkey on Kurds in 1984 with numbers of 15 000 and imprisoning "over half a million in concentration camps" over images of execution of kurds in Iraq; then Saddam Hussein promising Kurds in Northern Iraq autonomy but after almost 10 years of fruitless negotiations decides to use poison gas; then Gozeh survivor talking more about gas over various atrocity footage of civilians; commentator mentions that no official death toll given but journalists and witnesses report that it is "in the thousands"; then encouraged by US Kurds staged an uprising and this time Hussein killed "tens of thousands"; then Gozeh interviewed again talking about baby as only survivor of mass shooting of civilians, followed by footage of a baby in hospital; another video of execution, this one by Iranians killing Kurds; commentator concludes that once again we see mass killings and govts using them to "eliminate resistance"; "The Conflict in Ireland" talks about the need to distinguish between two types of man made famine, 1) being the unintended consequence of economic, social and political decisions that "intensify rather than recify an existing shortage of foods caused by natural events" and gives as example famine in china under Mao, 2) being intended and using hunger as weapon of war with example of 5-7 million in Ukraine under Stalin and Serbians starving Bosnians while exporting food to Russia in exchange for tech and weapons; then colonisation of Ireland with massacres of protestants and catholics; then in 1840s famine by weather and fungus "commenced to destroy the potato crop" killed 1.5 to 2 million died of starvation and disease and then commentator asks whether this famine was an action of genocide; describes the conflict in ireland as a result of colonisation; summarises that "once again we find that colonisation and religious and cultural differences are at the root of the conflicts that can and often do lead to genocide in one form and another"; interview with Bauer who stresses procedural nature of conflicts and genocides and that all conflicts need to be examined in their own right, but stresses that today's irish conflict is not a case of genocide and then Rosenbaum interviewed saying the same; "Central and South America" mentions rightwing govts of Americas as being supported by US leading to disappearance or death or deportation of "millions of individuals"; then footage of Pinochet in 1998 being wheeled around in wheelchair to face trial, then commentator gives quick history of Pinochet's regime with disappearances, killings of exile Argentinians, torture and rape in prisons over footage of protesting Argentinians in slow motion;
